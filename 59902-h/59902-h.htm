<div><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter I</span>--<span class='sc'>How it Began</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I think</span> it is strange how the scenes surrounding
big events stay in your memory. And
sometimes with years they become more clear
than the happening which impressed them. I
know this, because I remember a big four-posted
bed, and a lot of people around it--crying. And
then I remember someone lifting me up to kiss
the woman who was on the bed, but I do not
remember how she looked, and she was my
mother. She died at that time, and now I only
recall the crying people and the big four-posted
bed, and thinking it funny that a bed should
wear petticoats. It had a valance on it, you
see, and I evidently had not noticed it before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just in that same way I remember coming to
live with Uncle Frank Randolph, who is my
mother’s brother. And all I remember about
that is whiskers (they were miles long, I was
sure!) and the fact that it was raining. And
now--somehow--when I think of home and
saying good-bye to it, all I can see is swirling
yellow leaves and the dust and peanut shells and
bags that were flying in the wind around the
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I must start this story properly. It really
all began the day I rode a bicycle down the
Court-house steps on a bet. At that time I saw
nothing wrong in doing this, and to be frank I
was quite proud that I could do it, for there
are fifteen of those steps, and they’re quite
steep. After I did it I went over to the drug
store with Willy Jepson and had a soda, and then
we rode down to the ball field, and I pitched
nine innings for the Red Socks, after which I
thought I’d go home. I usually went home,
when I had a funny hollow feel under my belt.
And Uncle Frank didn’t mind my not being on
time for meals, so it didn’t matter. But when
I got in that night I knew something had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, Uncle Frank wasn’t reading
any of his bug books (Uncle Frank is very
famous for his bug knowledge, as you probably
know--some people even calling him the
“Second Fabre”), nor did he have on two
pairs of glasses. In fact, he was acting entirely
unnatural and quite as people of his age do when
they are preparing to be disagreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho hum! Where have you been?” he
asked, as I sat down at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down at the flats,” I answered. “Pitched
nine innings against Corkey McGowan’s Gang,
and we licked ’em.” And then, feeling some
pride, I reached for the spiced peaches and
chocolate cake and began to satisfy my craving
for food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you”--he began, hesitated, fumbled
for words, and then went on--“ah--like the--ah--gentler
pursuit of maidens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I didn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho hum!” he said. And he wagged his
head several times, which means he is perplexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old are you?” he asked next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him I was sixteen (I do every two or
three days), and then I asked him to pass the
strawberry preserve, because I found that I was
still hungry. He did, and then he asked me
whether I had eaten any meat. I had always
depended upon his absent-mindedness, and I
was surprised to see him so obviously upset and,
truth to be told, also a little annoyed; for I
knew that my life would be one series of explanations,
if he began to notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him that I hadn’t felt the need for anything
but chocolate cake and preserves, but he
wagged his head again and then he drew forth a
letter, and I knew by the shade and the address
which was engraved on the envelope that it was
from Aunt Penelope Randolph James, who lives
in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Penelope,” said Uncle Frank, “intimated
as much--where is it?--ho hum--oh, here we
are,” and then he read aloud this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘With your erratic habits, my dear, she is
probably growing up like a young Indian, and
I dare say she eats whatever she pleases, and
does whatever she likes.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Why shouldn’t I?” And then,
“Will you please pass the cake?” for I realized
that Uncle Frank was absorbed. He passed it
to me as he turned the page, and went on with:
“ ‘Obviously, she must have two or three years
in a good school, and one here, after her coming
out. I think she will be happy with Evelyn and
Amy, and we will love having her. I want to
know her, to have a few years of her, and a
chance to do whatsoever I can--because of
Nelly.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after that Uncle Frank stooped and stared
down at the letter. “Nelly” was the name of
my mother, and everyone who knew her loved
her a great deal; so much, in fact, that they
can’t speak of her easily. I always wish, and
so much, that it was hard for me to speak of
her. But, as I said before, I can only remember
the big four-posted bed and the crying people.
And I never did think that was quite fair, for
as I look on girls with mothers I realize I have
missed a great deal. I do think that I at least
might have been allowed to have a few years
of mine. But--that attitude doesn’t help me.
In this world you have to make up your mind
to lots that isn’t happy. For, if it IS, all your
complaints won’t change it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But--to get on. I was not impressed with
my aunt’s letter. I knew I wouldn’t have a
good time with my cousin Evelyn, because I
wear her old clothes sometimes, and by their
architecture I realize that our tastes are not in
common. They are very flossy. Usually she
chooses the kind of colour that soils when you
shin up a tree, and they have lots of buttons on
them that sort of catch when you take any mild
exercise, such as sliding down a barn roof on
your stomach (there are some ideal barns for
that in this section), and once, when I went
down the spouting from the Jepsons’ third floor
(we were playing hide-and-seek), I got hung up
by a button three feet from the ground and had
to scream for someone to loosen me, and was
consequently “It;” beside which I might have
been killed if it had been higher and the button
had not held. This is all mixed, but English is
not my strong point. I like gym. work best of
any study, and do best in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, beside that, I have a photograph of
Evelyn, and I realized from it that we wouldn’t
mean much to one another; also I have never got
along very well with girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I said: “But I feel that my education is
finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My uncle didn’t think so, and he tried not to
smile, which I think is a very impolite habit of
older people. I’d rather they would really smile
at you any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on. I said, and heatedly, I must
admit: “I can say the multiplication table up
to the twelves, and what more can you ask?”
And just to prove it I did, up to “twelve times
twelve is one hundred and fifty-nine;” but even
then he didn’t look convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are other things,” he said. I asked
what, but he wasn’t concrete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love life as it is,” I said, and none too
steadily. I couldn’t <span class='it'>bear</span> to think of leaving
Queensburg and Virginia! But uncle had got
up and was puttering around near the bay
window, where a bookcase stands, and so I
knew he didn’t hear me. I tried once more to
attract his attention, but he was looking at a
lot of coloured plates of the antennæ of some
sort of rare beetle, and I had to give up. But
after I had eaten another piece of cake and a
little more preserve, I got up. I picked up the
dishes and went to the kitchen with them, for I
always clear the table for Mrs. Bradly, who is
Uncle Frank’s housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was washing lettuce and splattering a
good deal of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bradly-dear,” I said, “do you know about
this letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set,” she said, and waved toward a stool
which stood before the back window. I settled
on it and looked out in the garden, which is a
shabby but dear place. The hollyhocks were
beginning to sag, I remember, and sprawled
every way; and the zinnias positively blazed
colour in the first taupe shadows of the
dusk.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was pretty, and it made you feel
<span class='it'>still</span>, as if you wanted to close your eyes halfway
and smile just a little; but it made you feel
sad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t understand that feeling, but
sometimes I have it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs. Bradly never
had it, for I asked her. But I think my mother
would have understood it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Pretty things
make it, and some kinds of music, and I don’t
know whether anything else does or not, but
those are the only things that have made <span class='it'>me</span>
have it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t imagine uncle ever felt
it. One day I asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Frank,” I said, “do you ever feel
sort of sad, and <span class='it'>awfully</span> happy, when it’s just
hazy, soft-dark outdoors and the crickets squeak
and everything seems cosy and yet sort of lonesome,
and you feel sort of contented and yet--miserable,
the way you do after you’ve eaten a
big Thanksgiving dinner----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crickets?” he said, looking over his glasses.
“Dinner? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ho hum!” And then he
went and got some engravings that he bought
in France, of some sort of cricket who was <span class='it'>eating
her husband</span>! They do it, quite a lot of them.
And although that does seem cruel, they are
very bright and intelligent in more ways than
just that. Their husbands weren’t useful and so
they ate them, which is more than some women
do. This is mixed, but as I said, gym. work
is where I star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of course I knew from that that he had
never felt that poetic longing, or whatever it
is, that I felt that night when Mrs. Bradly was
washing lettuce and I asked her about the
letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“High time,” she said, after I spoke, “that
you was sent off! <span class='it'>I</span> can’t do a thing with
yuh! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Playin’ <span class='it'>ball</span>, a great girl like <span class='it'>you</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bradly-<span class='it'>dear</span>!” I said. I hated displeasing
her. But she did not soften.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll stop!” I said, after a deep drawn
breath. I sighed, because playing ball means
a great deal in my life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bradly-dear sniffed and flopped the lettuce
terribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t play at Parsons,” I went on. She
didn’t reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to frightfully,” I said. “It is
quite an honour, Bradly-dear, to pitch on a
business men’s team. And they had to let Mr.
Horner do it, and he has a glass eye and let
three men sneak in to third, because he couldn’t
see out of the glass one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had wanted to play ball in Parsons. It is
a town some ten miles’ distance where <span class='it'>all</span> the
trains stop. They claim that it has ten thousand
inhabitants, which, of course, makes it a
city.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The reason I didn’t play was
because the minister, Mr. Diggs, called and
asked uncle not to let me. I don’t know why
religious people are so often disagreeable.
Bradly-dear spoke again, and witheringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Fine</span> life for the daughter of Nelly Randolph,”
she said, “to set here and <span class='it'>rot</span>! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The place is all right for your uncle--laws, he
could mash his bugs and put ’em on paper anywhere--but
for a girl----” Again she sniffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I love it,” I protested. “This sort of
a life is all I want----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother,” she went on, “spoke French
and was a lady. She could enter a room and
talk high-falutin and entertain <span class='it'>anybody</span>. She
could wave a fan--and you”--she faced me and
waved the lettuce quite as if that were an
ostrich plumed fan and she a court lady--“and
you,” she repeated, “you can wave a baseball
bat, but enter a room? Why, you slide your feet
under every rug that isn’t <span class='it'>glued</span> down, and you
tangle up in all the cheers, and you say ‘Hello’
when you should say ‘Howdy,’ and--well, it
ain’t no ways fittin’ or proper that you should
stay here and act like you was training for to
be Ringling’s star performer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t reply. There wasn’t anything to say.
For all that Bradly-dear had said was true. I
am very awkward--but--I like being so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother,” she said, slowly and
solemnly, “would ‘a’ wanted you to be learned
right and proper manners----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Bradly-dear,” I said, “if you
really think she would--and Uncle Frank thinks
I should----” And then I stopped speaking.
I had never felt so miserable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went out in the garden, and Willy Jepson
yelled over from the kitchen roof where he was
mending a fish line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come over and play catch,” he howled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t believe I can,” I said, sort of stiffly,
I guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” he yelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to tell the whole town!” I
answered, and after that he slid down, by way
of a grape arbour, and came over to stand near
the fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My last game of ball is played,” I said.
“It seems--I am too old for it, or something.
They--they don’t want me to. At least not in
big games, and I couldn’t indulge as an
amateur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My gosh,” he said, “that’s fierce!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded. I almost never cry--in fact, I don’t
cry any oftener than Willy Jepson does, but I
was near it then, so I looked down at the hedge
and broke twigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” he went on, “it’s <span class='it'>fierce</span>! You have
the making of a big leaguer--that is, if you’d
been a man--I say, it’s fierce. Your drop
curves----” He paused, and that pause meant
a lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just because you’re a girl?” he asked. I
admitted it. I had to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fierce!” he said again. His kindness
helped me a great deal. And his commendation
was not a light thing, for Willy does the
best spit balls in our county. They are really
dreams of poetic beauty and almost never fail
him. I looked up and said: “Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again he said: “My <span class='it'>gosh</span>, Nat, that’s
<span class='it'>fierce</span>!” And I did feel cheered up. Then I
heard uncle’s voice--calling me--and I went in.
I found him mounting a black beetle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more----” he began, and then looked
perplexed. He scratched his head and dislocated
one pair of his glasses, and I supplied,
“ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes,” he said, “that <span class='it'>was</span> it.” And
then: “You are to go to your aunt’s the last
of this month.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs. Bradly thinks she
can get your clothes ready by that time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We will miss you, my child.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let me
see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ho hum! Long feelers <span class='it'>and</span> hard
back--page nine hundred and twenty-seven.” I
left him to his bugs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to the kitchen, but I only stood in the
door for a moment, and then I backed away,
for Mrs. Bradly was crying--awfully hard--her
face buried in the roller towel. And I knew it
was because I was going away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I felt
that way too, but I never cry, so I went up to
my room and got out my fishing tackle and tried
to make a fly for a shallow, shady stream out
of some gray and green silk and a grasshopper
wing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But it didn’t divert me much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I didn’t think I could exist very long in real
civilization. I knew I didn’t want to. All the
loveliness that I felt earlier in the evening was
gone, and all that was left was an ache, a dull,
sodden, gray, growing-larger-all-the-time ache.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You see, I cared awfully for outdoors
and the sports that keep you there. They were
all I really knew of life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And my New
York relatives live in an apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be bored,” I thought, “and miserably,
horribly unhappy!” But--whatever else
I was--I was not bored! Oh, my soul, no!
Not for one instant! Sometimes it was almost
ghastly, that mystery which gripped and held us
all, and even now I tremble to think of phases
of it; but it gave more in the end than it took,
which is the curious way of much pain and discomfort.
When I think that--but I mustn’t
begin now. For that part comes much later.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter II</span>--<span class='sc'>Good-byes</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> next few weeks were so crowded that the
events which came in them have a kaleidoscopic
flavour. Everyone called on me, and everyone
gave me advice. The calls, the advice, the
shrill of the locusts, the way the sunlight looked
in the garden, and the braid which Mrs. Bradly
insisted must be put on my new dresses, all
tangled. I can’t think of one thing without
having something else, that came in that time,
creep in. I suppose it was because I was so
hurried that nothing was sorted. It all simply
sunk in my mind together as I rushed; and, of
course, there was no calm between, in which
one’s consciousness builds fences, or tethers a
thought in its proper pasture. My going away
acted like a big egg-beater on everything that
happened then; everything was too well mixed
and--flavoured with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradly wept over everything, including
my favourite things to eat, which she cooked
for every meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corn fritters,” she’d say, and then begin
to catch her breath. “Won’t be so long now
that I <span class='it'>can</span> make ’em for you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thought
you’d <span class='it'>relish</span> ’em.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And then she’d go
out in the wood-shed, pretending that she needed
a little kindling to hurry the fire. But I knew
she didn’t. And it made me feel awfully. I
think I was never quite so unhappy as then,
when everyone was so kind to me. But I didn’t
cry, because that isn’t the way I show unhappiness.
Hurts make a hard, heavy load
which roosts on my heart and does something
to my lungs. They want to take long breaths,
but feel squeezed. Sometimes I think this sort
of misery is really more uncomfortable than
tears, but at least no one can see whether your
heart has a red nose, and of course outside tears
leave traces. There are advantages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willy Jepson seemed to understand how I
felt, more than anyone else, which was surprising.
He sat with me a good deal in the garden,
while I sewed on braid. I was not interested in
the braid, nor sewing it on, but Mrs. Bradly
made me put yards on everything. She said:
“Yuh gotta look swell in New York. Take this
here and put three rows above the hem.” And--for
the first time in my life, I sewed. We put
narrow ribbon velvet on my thin things, and lace
wherever it could be attached. When I had to
rip it off, I did almost cry; and not because of
the work, but because dear Bradly thought it
was so fine. I can’t quite explain, and I haven’t
time here. But when people whom you love
think things are beautiful, you don’t like to
destroy them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatcha doing that for?” Willy asked one
afternoon. We were sitting in the arbour. I
told him Mrs. Bradly thought you had to be
trimmed a lot in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is,” he said, looking at my skirt a
little doubtfully, “and it doesn’t look like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That annoyed me because I’d pricked my
fingers a lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got to,” I said. “I’m going to
wear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have it ripped off in two days,” he
replied. “I know <span class='it'>you</span>. You’ll shin up something,
or slide down something, and that stuff’ll
trail behind you for blocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’ll I slide down in New York?” I
asked resentfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he answered, “there are fire-escapes.”
I sniffed at that. I never dreamed
I ever would--but of course that time I didn’t
know what was coming. After that we were
quiet. I sewed hard, and Willy looked at me.
I felt him, as you do, and wondered whether I
was losing my petticoat or anything. When he
spoke he did something noble, which I shall
never forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Nat,” he said, after a cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” I answered. “I have nine more
yards of this stuff to lam on. It goes around
the sleeves too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, and his voice was very
gruff, “it’s this way; if you get too darned
homesick you can always come back and
marry me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I appreciated that. I really did, although it
was not my idea of a romantic proposal. My
reading taste most closely embraces Alger, but
I have read a few love stories, and Willy didn’t
act at all like the man in “The Rosary.” But
Evelyn says that men never do act like books.
She has had several proposals. She says they
look sort of scared, and as if they wished they
hadn’t begun it, and usually stutter a little,
beside gulping. But, as I said, before criticizing
Willy’s technique, I was grateful, for I
thought if nothing else turned up I could marry
Willy before I became an old maid. No woman
really wants to be one; she only says so after
<span style='font-size:smaller'>SHE IS</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you tell any of the fellows!” said
Willy, after a few moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I wouldn’t. Then I thanked him and
said I might call his bluff when I was about
twenty-two or so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That memory is closely
wrapped in braid and a blue-and-pink plaid dress.
Aunt Penelope gave that one to the janitor’s
daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willy’s offer was a help, for Uncle Frank had
told me that I must try to stay in New York
with Aunt Penelope for the three years, anyway.
He explained about the locusts and how
they went through stages, and he thought it
would take about three years for my country
shell to slip off and be replaced by the new one,
which New York would grow underneath. It
seemed Aunt Penelope has a country place, but
uncle was afraid it was not very wild (it is at
Southampton), and she wants me to go there
with her. When I heard that I wasn’t to come
home at all, I almost expired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But anyone needs a vacation,” I said, sort
of shakily. “If I can’t climb trees or go bare-foot
at least <span class='it'>once</span> a summer, I shall <span class='it'>die</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
But Uncle Frank had forgotten me, and got up
to hunt a picture of a variety of the praying
mantis, which he found climbing a tree. It did
not cheer me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I wish I was one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said, “Rare specimen, rare specimen,
ho hum!” and again went to poring over
his books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those weeks passed. In them I found that
I cared a lot about many people whom I had
almost avoided before I knew I was to go away.
Even old Mr. Diggs, who growls and used to
complain of me so often (I occasionally broke
a window in his house; it stands near the diamond
which is nearest school), stopped me and gave
me a mouth-organ he had had when he was a
boy. I appreciated it, for I knew it meant lots
to him, if it wasn’t exactly useful to me. When
I showed it to Mrs. Bradly, she said, “<span class='it'>Swell</span>
thing to play on in New York!” and really
laughed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But afterward she went to the
wood-shed--to get kindling, and I knew she
was thinking of the New York part of her joke.
Aunt Hetty James knitted me a bridge jacket,
and she used to come regularly to talk with
uncle about my ways. And five other women,
whom I hadn’t thought liked me much, made
me bridge jackets too, but they were all different
colours--I mean the jackets, not the women.
I had seventeen pin-cushions given me, and nine
boudoir caps. Jim Hooker, who is the town
disgrace (but with whom I often fished, meeting
him a little way out, on the Chanceford Pike;
he can cast better than anyone I ever saw), gave
me a collection of flies that were wonderful.
And Willy Jepson gave me a box of lavender
correspondence cards, which I thought beautiful
before I had become acclimatized to New York.
They had pink edges and gold N’s on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be brief, everyone was kind to me, and it
made my throat feel stuffy. It was honestly a
relief to go, for I knew it had to come, and the
feeling of its coming was like that pressure that
going to the dentist’s to-morrow lays on your
spirit. And at last the day did come, and I went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning of that day, I went out in the
garden and looked at it carefully. I thought
that perhaps I could pack the way it looked in
my heart, as I had Uncle Frank’s face, and
Bradly-dear’s fat figure, just dimly indented at
the waistline with her starchy, blue-checked
apron.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And so I walked around a little
while. August had made it sag, but it was
lovely; grass was sprouting between the red
bricks of the walk, the picket fence was leaning
and, being grayed from sun and the rain, made
a lovely background for the late flowers and the
dusty foliage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the fence was the spot where Willy
Jepson taught me to pitch, and on the small
platform outside the back door was the hook
where they used to tie me when I was a tiny
girl and ran away so much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Everything
was familiar, and because of that very dear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And because I knew it and had lived in that
house, loved, and been loved by the people of
that house, it was home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willy Jepson got up early that morning. He
came out in the back yard carrying a cruller in
one hand and four plums in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavy rain last night,” he said. “Breakfast
isn’t ready yet. Thought I’d take a bite
to carry me on till Liza gets up. Got packed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send me a line sometimes,” he said,
between bites. “And what I said about marrying
me goes. I’ll <span class='it'>let</span> you, if you can’t stand it
in New York, although a woman hampers a
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t think that was a happy manner of
putting it, and said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shucks!” he replied. “Don’t expect
slush from <span class='it'>me</span>. I’m not anxious to get married.
I say so frankly. A woman hurts a man’s career,
but considering your drop curves and sense, I’m
willing to help you out if you <span class='it'>need</span>, really <span class='it'>need</span>,
helping.” Then he went on eating his plums.
“I <span class='it'>like</span> you,” he continued after several chews;
“it isn’t as if I <span class='it'>didn’t</span>.” And he didn’t look
at me, so I knew he wasn’t as averse to marrying
me as he seemed. I’ve known Willy for a long
time and so I understood quite a lot he didn’t say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I shall trouble you,” I said,
“although I am grateful, and it is nice to think
that there is somewhere where you can go, if
your family won’t receive you before your education
is finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willy nodded and went on chewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Bradly-dear called, and I knew that
breakfast was ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Willy,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming down to the station,” he said, and
very gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “All right,” and went toward the
house. When I reached the porch I looked
back, and I knew that Willy felt badly, for Willy
wasn’t chewing.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter III</span>--<span class='sc'>Mrs. Crane’s Story</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> I said before, almost all I remember about
going away is the leaves, bags, dust, and peanut
shells which whirled in the wind around the
station platform. A great many people came
down to see me off, which was dear of them,
considering that my conduct has not always
been exemplary. And they all kissed me and
said that they hoped New York would be pleasant
and that I wouldn’t be lonesome, and a few of
them, women, said that they hoped it would
tame me down, which I did not entirely enjoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the minister came down, and he put me
out of the choir last year because I let mice
loose in the middle of Miss Hooker’s solo,
which she finished from the top of the organ,
in a squawk (Willy Jepson dared me to), and
it was especially nice of the minister to come
down, I thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Frank coughed a lot and blamed it on
the dust, but I think he was feeling badly because
I was going away. “Ho hum,” he said, “dust
pretty bad, pretty bad! I have here----”
And then he pulled out a little box in which he’d
mounted a little beetle, which stays in the ground
three years and then comes out and acquires
lovely shiny wings and flies, beside making a
real song with its hind legs. He said he hoped
I would understand the implied lesson, and he
meant that I was to dig hard at knowledge for
three years, not that I was to attempt noises
with my hind legs. He said when things looked
hard I was to look at that little insect who so
patiently waited for wings and worked so hard
to get them and to be ready to float and make
attractive tunes. And I said I would keep it on
my bureau next to the china cat with a hollow
back for matches that Bradly-dear gave me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then there was a great deal of kissing;
Uncle Frank ho-hummed some and coughed,
Bradly-dear frankly wept, Willy Jepson reminded
me that I could lean on him, <span class='it'>if I had to</span>, leaves
swirled madly as the train pulled in and made
a real breeze around the station, and--I started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I carried five bouquets which had been presented,
an umbrella, a suitcase, and a shirt-waist
box which held all those things which the
trunk wouldn’t hold, beside a basket of Miss
Hooker’s sheep-nose apples. I have often eaten
them, but she never <span class='it'>gave</span> me any before. I was
ever so grateful. Her orchard is walled and
guarded by a dog, and getting her apples is
really difficult. We used to do it by dropping
a packing-box over the dog and then adding
bricks, to be sure that he’d stay, but that is
another story. The gift of those apples really
touched me, but they didn’t taste as good. I
can understand how self-made men feel about
their fortunes. It is perfectly natural to enjoy
something that you steal under adverse circumstances.
It sort of makes you feel clever, which
feeling everyone enjoys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to get on. I was to go to Doctor Crane’s
for the night. His wife was a great friend of
my mother’s, and has always written me more
or less regularly, beside sending me things at
Christmas-time. And, although it is hard for
me to meet strangers, I really looked forward
to going there. And it was lovely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I arrived in Baltimore at eight that night, and
I was never so frightened. In the first place, I
had never been in a large city before, and the
crowd was dense. And then--I am used to
being near people I know, and I hadn’t spoken
a word to anyone beside the conductor all day.
I began to feel terribly lonely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, after I had got to the waiting-room with
the help of a porter, I stood and waited, feeling
intensely miserable. And--when I heard, “Miss
Natalie Page?” in a nice man’s voice, I said,
“Thank you <span class='it'>ever</span> so much, God----” (inside)
for I was beginning to wonder what I should do
if I wasn’t met. I didn’t feel as if I could go
out and take a taxi as I had been told to. For
I was sure I wouldn’t know a taxi from any other
kind of a car, although Miss Hooker said they
had flags on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it was Doctor Crane, and he has a real
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he went on, “it is Miss Natalie Page,
<span class='it'>and</span> some baggage,” and we both laughed.
Then he got a porter, had my things put in his
small car, and we started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Mrs. Crane has a little supper waiting,”
he said very cheerfully (I am sure he
somehow knew that I felt timid and a little
alone), “for I heard her ordering patty-cases
and French pastries this morning. I don’t suppose
you <span class='it'>like</span> them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I was sure I would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he asked about uncle and my trip, and
whether I’d ever been in a city before, and I
answered him, trying ever so hard not to be
frightened by the great crowds that ran right in
front of cars at the crossings. I was quite sure
we could kill someone, but we didn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nervous?” asked Doctor Crane as we
turned up into a quieter street which went past
the Walters’ Art Gallery (Doctor Crane told me
what it was). I said I wasn’t exactly, but that
I expected to see someone killed in the mob
through which we had threaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed and replied that he didn’t have
to do it with a Ford--because he was a doctor.
And then we rode quite a distance, although it
didn’t seem so, for I was interested, and at last
we stopped before a lovely old white house.
A little girl of about thirteen stood on the door-step,
and as we neared I heard her call:
“Mother, she’s come! They’re here!
<span class='it'>Mother!</span>” And then she stopped yelling into
the house and ran down to open the door of
the car for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Mary Elinor Crane,” she said shyly,
but she smiled so genuinely that I liked her
right away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the Doctor, “the only girl we
have left, and if <span class='it'>she</span> marries there’ll be a massacre
around here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Mrs. Crane came to the door, and
I forgot Mary Elinor and the Doctor. She
kissed me and said, “Why, my dear little girl!”
and I felt as if I had always known her. “Just
like your mother,” she went on, “just like Nelly
Randolph--the prettiest girl in the Green Spring
Valley!” And I saw that her eyes were too
bright, and swimming. And then she changed
the subject abruptly and said: “Come in,
dear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You must be tired.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ted,
have Lucky take those bags up to the blue
room”--Lucky was the darkest little coon I
ever saw--“and,” she went on, “Mary Elinor,
you take Miss Natalie upstairs and see that
she has clean towels and has a nice chance to
brush up, and then come down to supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” said Mary Elinor, as she slipped
her arm through mine. And we went up some
splendid broad, winding stairs which led to a
great upstairs hall. It was the loveliest house
I’d ever seen. I could only gasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were dark old pictures in beautifully
wide, gently mellowed gilt frames, and funny old-fashioned
pieces of furniture standing here and
there. I particularly noticed one, and Mary
Elinor told me it was a frame on which people
of our great-great-grandmother’s time did embroidery.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And on the floor were rag rugs,
in the prettiest colours. They belonged with the
old mahogany. I don’t know about periods or
anything like that, but I could feel that they
fitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we went along, Mary Elinor talked ever
so fast. She said that they had always been
poor, since people almost never paid the Doctor
unless they were awfully sick and wanted him to
come again--and most always they were only
<span class='it'>really</span> sick once. But she said that they had an
aunt who gave them a lot of money and that
now they were comfortable and had ice-cream as
often as three times a week, and two cars, one
of which her mother ran. And she has two
sisters, and a brother who was visiting then and
was going to college. And that little girl is the
aunt of two children! A boy and a girl. She
said her sister Barbara almost named her baby
after her, but it happened to be a boy, and of
course a name like Mary Elinor was out of the
question. She told me quite a lot as I washed
up, and said she wished I would stay, as she
missed her sisters and brother and would like to
have me around. I thought it was dear of her,
and then, as I was ready and awfully hungry,
we went downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there--I began to understand that it was
not all history, geography, French, English, and
mathematics that I was to learn in New York.
I began to see what I never had seen--or could
see--in our little village. That is--the prettier
way of living. For even Miss Hooker’s table
never looked like Mrs. Crane’s. And Miss
Hooker went to the World’s Fair, studied singing
in Washington in 1895, and has been as
far West as Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was lovely. I did wish that Uncle Frank
and Bradly-dear could see it! There was a
lunch set on it, and the way the table gleamed
between the lace edges was beautiful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There were candles with pink shades, and in a
high glass basket late autumn roses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Then there were tiny baskets of nuts and
candies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could only look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “I think that is <span class='it'>beautiful</span>, Mrs.
Crane!” and she said, “<span class='it'>Dear</span> child!” which
wasn’t exactly an answer, but which satisfied
me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then we ate, and the things were
very good. I did enjoy myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They laughed and talked a lot, and we had
such a good time. Mrs. Crane and Mr. Crane
seem to talk by looking, too, which is queer--and
yet, I suppose if you’ve been in the same
house with a person for a great many years,
and loved them lots, you would understand every
little flicker that makes a change in expression,
just as I understand what sort of a fly fish will
want--from a look at the light and the depth
of the water, and the sort of wings the insects
have that hover above.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sometimes I
think that everything in the world is observation,
that that is the only education. And that
education perhaps, after all, only tries to make
you do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was deeply impressed by the French pastries.
Of course, I had never had them before, because
almost everyone in Queensburg does their own
baking, and there isn’t any bakery nearer than
Parsons, and that deals in nothing more involved
than macaroons. I asked Mrs. Crane whether
she thought that I could get them in New York,
and she said I could. I was ever so glad, for I
think that if you are very homesick you can be
diverted as well by cheerful things to go inside
as by cheerful surroundings. I told them so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Elinor agreed with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eating,” she said, “is underrated. It has
a great deal to do with the set of your spirits
(mother, I would <span class='it'>love</span> having another pastry--the
brown one was a <span class='it'>complete</span> disappointment,
and I <span class='it'>only</span> ate it to save it), and when I grow up
and am a doctor I am going to advocate complete
freedom in gratifying appetite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better advocate complete freedom in engulfing
soda mints,” advised Doctor Crane.
“Most people need ’em, even while eating with
care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Elinor didn’t answer. She was too
much occupied with the pink pastry. When she
did speak, she announced something which excited
me. “Natalie,” she said, “mother’s
going to give you a present to-night, something
that is really yours and ever so valuable because
of historic association, and I am so anxious to
see you get it. For it is really yours, your
moth----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her mother interrupted with “That’ll do,
Chicky,” and she didn’t finish. And then an
old coloured woman came in with little cups of
coffee for Doctor and Mrs. Crane, and chocolate
with whipped cream on top for Mary Elinor and
me. We walked a little longer, went in a yellow
room and played the victrola, and then I said
good-night, and Mary Elinor and I went up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I had got undressed and was in bed,
Mrs. Crane tapped on my door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearie,” she said, “may I come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat up and said, “Oh, <span class='it'>please</span> do,” just as
Mary Elinor, from way down the corridor,
screamed a request to come over too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Crane asked if she might, and I said
I’d love having her, so she did. When she
came along, Mrs. Crane said: “Get in with
Natalie--if she doesn’t mind. Daddy hasn’t any
time to fuss with colds now, and this is a long
story----” And then, as Mary Elinor got
under the covers, Mrs. Crane opened a square
box which was covered in yellow satin (a satin
which had once been white), and held it so I
could see a beautiful bracelet inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, my dear,” she said, “was your
mother’s, and her father gave it to me a short
time after she died.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Isn’t it lovely?”
She held out the box, and very carefully I
picked it up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was a wonderful thing
of soft, dull gold, and the sort that they wore at
that time--broad and firm looking.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had
a queer feeling to think that it had been around
my mother’s arm, and I ran my fingers around
the inside of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then Mrs. Crane leaned
over and clasped it on my arm and kissed me.
And I was awfully afraid I was going to cry,
but I didn’t. I find if you swallow two or three
times, very hard, when tears are near, that you
can divert them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mrs. Crane as she sat down on
a little rocking-chair that stood near the bed,
“that has a history. A great history. It belonged
to Madam Jumel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She married
Aaron Burr, you know, when she was an old
woman and he was seventy-eight. Nice rosy
age for romance, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was glad to have something at which to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she went on, “that was her bracelet.
It happened that one of your great-great-grandmothers
sailed for Bordeaux on the same ship in
which Madam Jumel took passage. Madam
Jumel was then travelling under the name of
the widow of the Vice-President of the United
States (although she divorced Aaron Burr after
they had been married for less than a year), and
a very grand lady indeed she thought herself to
be. She had letters to write to French nobility,
letters which she wished to send from Bordeaux,
announcing her arrival; but her French was
faulty, and she found the task of writing them
extreme, and the result far from her personal
satisfaction. So--your great-great-grandmother,
being a person of education and the nicest sort
of French, helped her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One noon, Madam Jumel waited for her at
the entrance to the dining-saloon, and as your
relative approached said: ‘Pardon, madam, but
I heard you conversing in the most elegant and
genteel French (I could not help but overhear
it), and I wondered whether you would be so
good as to offer me your assistance. My letters
to royalty’--and history says she waved a hand
most airily--‘are things that must be just so,
as you can understand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am proud that
crowned heads bow to me, but laws, my dear,
it is a pest!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the long and the short of it is that she
was helped, and by your great-great-grandmother,
Natalie.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After the letters had
been corrected and little niceties were added,
Madam Jumel expressed deep gratitude.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
‘Thank you a million times, dear friend,’ she
said, in very quaintly broken French. And
then, taking this bracelet from her arm, added:
‘No doubt one day, when I am dead (but not
forgotten), the bracelet which I retain, the companion
to this, will be displayed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They
will say it belonged to the widow of Burr (my
dear, he was a wretch!), but this one, which I
give you, and you must accept (I will have no
noes!) your descendants will display as having
belonged to your friend--a friend who was helped
by a friend. Let me clasp it, please. Ah, there
we are, and well it looks upon your arm, although
it has not the round fairness of <span class='it'>mine</span>.’ And--that
is the story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked down at the bracelet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did my mother wear it?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Crane’s face changed curiously, and
then she said she had--but not often.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she did?” I questioned further.
“Really did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear,” she responded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a picture in the Jumel mansion,”
she went on, after a few moments, “which you
will doubtless see. It shows Madam Jumel
wearing the companion to this bracelet. The
painting was done in Rome, the last time
she went abroad, which was the time your
great-great-grandmamma met her. In it she is
sitting between her niece and nephew--the
nephew who afterward, angered at her, threw
an ink-well at his aunt’s face in the painting,
missed it, and left a scar above his own head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t that frightful!” I said. (I was
thinking of the aim, more than the motive.)
“He must have been a rotten pitch.” But
Mrs. Crane thought I meant his anger was
wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was,” she said, “and yet--old Madam
Jumel was a queer piece. She adopted children
who, one by one, all left her. She was a lonely
old woman and one pities her--but, Natalie--the
world gives back what you put in it. And
usually when people are lonely, they have been
cruel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so,” I said. “What was the
matter with him? Didn’t he ever play ball?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Crane didn’t know, but went on with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be interested in the Jumel Mansion,
because of your bracelet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And in Madam
Jumel. Her husband, Aaron Burr, killed Alexander
Hamilton in a duel; and Alexander Hamilton’s
son, who was Alexander Hamilton, Junior,
was her lawyer, even during the time when she
was Mrs. Burr.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wasn’t that strange?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are lots of queer things about her,
and more about her influence----” Again Mrs.
Crane’s face changed (I wondered what made
it), and she looked at the bracelet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after a little more talk, she kissed me,
ordered Mary Elinor off, and put out the
light.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When I was alone I put the bracelet
under my pillow and kept my hand on it. I
loved feeling it. It was nice to think that my
mother had worn it, if only for a few times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I lay awake thinking of it for a long time; and
I am sure it must have been away past eleven
when I at last slept. Before I did I thought of
Uncle Frank and Mrs. Bradly. I wasn’t worried
about Uncle Frank, for he always has bugs.
But I did hope that Bradly-dear wasn’t crying.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When I thought she might be, I was
miserable again--and then I found the bracelet
to be a comfort. I put my hand on the inside
of it, for Mrs. Crane did say my mother wore
it sometimes. And it seems queer, but it helped
lots--lots!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter IV</span>--<span class='sc'>What Mary Elinor told Me</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> next morning I got up quite early, and
Mrs. Crane, who did too, helped me to assemble
my things. She loaned me a suitcase for the
bridge jackets and my pin-cushions (which would
<span class='it'>not</span> go in the trunk!), and then, taking a few
of the best flowers from each bouquet, made
them into a small one, which she pinned on me
with a lovely little gold-headed pin, which she
called a “violet pin.” And all the time we
worked together she talked most comfortingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If everything seems right different at first,
dear,” she said, as she folded up my nightie
and bath-robe, “don’t worry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Things
have a way of smoothing out, you know. And
you’ll accommodate yourself. I suppose you’re
used to being outdoors?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I responded that I was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” she said, and very cheerfully,
“think of the walks you can take in New York!
The things you can see! The most beautiful
buildings, and parks, and dear knows what all,
honey! Why, you’ll have a beautiful time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sort of hope,” I confided, “that I can
get to one of the big league games.” It was
hard for me to speak of it, because I did so want
to go, and I was afraid it wouldn’t be suitable
or something. For, almost invariably, things
that are pleasant are not proper to do. I’ve
always noticed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Crane thought my uncle would take
me if I told him how much I cared about going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Do</span> you?” I said, and ever so earnestly, for
it meant a great deal to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how he could help it,” she
answered; and then, after kissing me, she told
me to hurry on with my dressing and come down
to breakfast. And I did. As I did my hair
(which was, at that time, a very simple operation,
and involved three licks of the comb and one
rubber strap), I thought of Mrs. Crane, and I
did wish I could stay with her, for I began to
see that my clothes did look strange, and I knew
that she would help me to fix them without laughing
at me or them. Bradly-dear had had them
made so that I was too aware of them, and so
that no one else could overlook them. It is hard
to explain, but the trimmings and the dresses
didn’t <span class='it'>mix</span>, and the braid drew attention to the
dresses, and the dresses drew attention to the
braid, which was not all moored on the level. I
anchored a good deal of it myself, and I can tell
you that it is far easier to pitch against a left-handed
batter than to put on a yard of serpentine
braid, beside being a great deal more interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as I had got my dress on and was trying
to hook it under the arm, someone tapped, and
after my “Come in,” I found it was Mary
Elinor. “Bill’s home,” she said first. “He
just got in. He’s glad he’s going to meet you.
He likes baseball too. I have something to tell
you, but I don’t just know how. It is a delicate
thing to say and requires womanly tact, of which
I have not much, since father whips us if we tell
fibs. That kind of an upbringing is an awful
handicap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down after this, and began to plait
her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you feel as if you ought to say it,” I
said, “go to it. I won’t mind.” And she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about the bracelet,” she said.
“Mother doesn’t believe in such things, but
Aunt Eliza (she’s our cook) knows <span class='it'>all</span> about them,
and <span class='it'>she</span> says that probably the ghost of the first
owner has put a ‘hant’ on it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe in such stuff,” I answered.
“You know how niggers are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” Mary Elinor answered, “but--well,
look here, your own <span class='it'>mother</span> thought
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought what?” I asked, and quickly. I
was getting excited, and I wanted her to come
to the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought Madam Jumel didn’t want anyone
to wear her bracelet, and made them unhappy--in
some queer way--if they did. <span class='it'>Everyone who
wears that bracelet has awful things happen to
’em!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” I asked. I sat down on the foot
of the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, mother said your mother said that
because she wore it the first time your father
kissed her, he died with pneumonia before he’d
ever seen you. She said <span class='it'>that</span> made it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it,” I asserted. I was
annoyed. It didn’t sound like Mrs. Crane.
Mary Elinor bridled, and her eyes snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then <span class='it'>don’t</span>,” she said. “I only thought
someone <span class='it'>ought</span> to tell you, before something
frightful happened to <span class='it'>you</span>. And I don’t lie, Miss
Natalie Page. You can ask my father, because
he taught me not to and----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you don’t,” I answered, “and I’m
sorry I said that.” And then I decided I’d
better hear the story. Beside, I wanted to. So
I told her to tell me all about what she knew of
it, and she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems they have a room which they call
“the winter room,” and this contains a cosy
little alcove, lighted by a high window, which is
remote and an ideal reading spot. And one day
after Mrs. Crane got Uncle Frank’s letter, the
letter about my coming, Mary Elinor happened
to be there, reading. It was a book she had
read before, and of course she knew what happened
next, and so she wasn’t especially interested,
and what her mother and father said sort
of floated in her consciousness and rooted, she
said, before she realized that she was listening.
Then, since they hadn’t known she was there,
she decided not to enlighten them. She knew
that they would be shocked by her presence, and
she assured me that she always tried to be considerate.
And, she reasoned further, that since
she had heard so much, almost involuntarily,
there was no use stuffing up her ears, and beside,
she was interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It <span class='it'>was</span> interesting, but I didn’t believe it--then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ted,” Mrs. Crane had said (Doctor Crane’s
first name is Theodore), “I want to give Natalie
Page that bracelet, but--you know poor Nelly’s
foolish fear of it bothers me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” Doctor Crane answered, and
Mary Elinor said she knew he was smoking, by
the tight way he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it is,” Mrs. Crane said, “isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course it is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nothing the
matter with that bracelet. My dear, how could
it affect anything? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And as for poor Carter
Page’s pneumonia” (Carter Page was my father,
and he was an Admiral in the Navy), “he went
off with that because of a severe climatic change,
a bad sailing, and a weak heart. And of course
Nelly was upset both physically and mentally
by that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But before,” said Mrs. Crane. “You
know her little sister--the one who was killed in
that Carrol County Hunt--thrown from a horse--well,
she’d <span class='it'>borrowed this bracelet and wore it
that day</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Doctor Crane, “that’s
simply coincidence. And it certainly proves
nothing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think Nelly’s daughter ought
to have it, because of its historic value, and I
wouldn’t be bothered for a second by those
imaginings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mary Elinor heard him scratch a match
and relight his pipe. She said that it was really
interesting the way she could tell what was going
on without seeing it. It was like movies for the
blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose,” said Mrs. Crane, “there is
something in that sort of thing (although, of
course, there isn’t) and I did give this child
something that would----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Doctor Crane asked if she needed a
tonic, which is his way of saying that people are
cross, or crazy, or nervous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Crane laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ted,” she said, “I know I <span class='it'>am</span> crazy, but
when I remember it----” And then Mary
Elinor said her voice became soft as she told
this story.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had heard it, but never told
this way. And here it is:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was born while my father was cruising the
Pacific. Each day he had hoped to be able to
come home, but orders were against him and,
like all sailors, he had to abide by those and not
by the dictates of his heart. And so--I grew for
three months, and then one day my mother
heard that father was to come home and would
probably be in port within three or four weeks.
Mrs. Crane’s description of that was lovely.
And she could describe it, for my mother then
lived in the Green Spring Valley with grandpapa,
and Mrs. Crane went there often, taking Alix,
Barbara, and William. Mary Elinor <span class='it'>wasn’t</span>, at
that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excitement, Ted!” said Mrs. Crane. “I
wish you might have seen it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But you remember
how I told of it----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Nelly was the happiest little person
I’ve ever seen, and simply delighted over the
beautiful baby she had waiting to show her husband.
Each day little Natalie (who really was
a sweet child) was dressed in her best and ready
for display. For Nelly couldn’t realize that
three weeks at least must elapse before her big
husband could come home to her. And she herself,
pretty as ever, would wail: ‘Dear, <span class='it'>do</span> you
think I’m as pretty as I was? Carter always
thought me pretty, you know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>Do</span> you?’
And then, quickly: ‘But if he doesn’t there’s
the baby--and she <span class='it'>is</span> a beauty!’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always was a coquette,” said Doctor Crane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” admitted Mrs. Crane. “Nelly knew
her husband was wild about her. They really
loved each other too much--the other would have
been easier if they had been a bit closer to normal
caring----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then came what I have always known,
and been saddened by. For my poor little
mother, after getting me all ready for my daddy,
and herself all ready for him, too--both of us in
our prettiest things--had a wire. And in this
she heard that he was dead. And when she
heard that she took off the bracelet (I did not
know this part of the story) and flung it far
from her. And then she fainted. And she never
cried at all. Which I can understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, a few months went on, and, although
they said I cared a great deal for her, she didn’t
seem to care for anything--even me. And quite
naturally, she began to be ill. I suppose that
there was nothing left for which life was worth
the living.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A big mammy took care of
me, and my grandpapa loved me a lot, but I
am sure, even then, that I wanted my mother
most.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One day, perhaps six or eight
months after my father’s death, my mother
asked for the Jumel bracelet. And when they
brought it to her (with a dent in the side, which
had come from her throwing it) she smiled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
“I’m going to take it to its jealous owner,
Chloe,” she said to my mammy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Or at
least--I will take it where no one else can wear
it--and where Madam Jumel will not mind its
being worn.” And then again she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she died she had it on her arm, and
of course she had meant that she was to be
buried in it. But Chloe, my mammy, would not
have that. She did not believe in carrying unhappiness
to the other world, and, like a great
many of her race, believed that you could take
things with you--if they went in your coffin.
Which is, of course, silly. For all you really
take is love, and the whitest part of your soul.
I am sure all jealousies, and hurts and little
things stay here, and I like to believe so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But to get on, old Chloe told my grandfather,
and he, a broken-hearted old man, took it off.
And then he kissed my mother’s arm, at the
spot where the bracelet had made a mark, and
he said: “It’s all right now, my little girl, <span class='it'>isn’t</span>
it? It’s all right now!” For he hoped she was
very happy. And then he went off and sat down
on the porch, his head sagging down on his
chest and in his hands the Jumel bracelet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were three years which followed, three
years in which nothing happened. And then, my
grandfather began to lose money. I remember
that time, although I was only three and a half.
I remember his holding me very tight and pressing
his face against my chest; and I remember
that I always hugged him and said, “Granddad--<span class='it'>dear</span>,”
for Chloe, who taught me everything,
had said: “Your granddaddy done gotta have
a lotta love, honey chile. He done gotta, for
he’s lost a lotta love--a powerful lot! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
For two of his daughters and his wife had all
gone--within eight years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I did love him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember also how, when they brought him
in, bleeding, and with his eyes wide open but
sightless, how I felt, how I screamed, and how
even Chloe could not stop me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Little by
little he had lost money. And the small sums
had worried him, and he had tried to catch them
back with the big ones. And somehow, after a
little time of this--there were no big ones. And
then--one day in hunting season they found my
dear grandfather by a stile, where they thought
he had fallen and accidentally discharged his
gun, which is, of course, possible. Anyway--he
had evidently lain there for a good many
hours, and he had bled to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they found the Jumel bracelet in his
pocket--flattened and bent. Looking as if someone
had stepped on it, ground it into the earth,
and--believed the story!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chloe took charge of it, and Mrs. Crane saw
it when she came out to take charge of me until
I should go to Uncle Frank’s. And Mrs. Crane
took the bracelet, because she thought no one
of our family would want to see it, since even
Uncle Frank seemed to believe in the ill omens
it carried. She had it straightened and made
whole again, and sometimes wore it; but not
often, since she cared deeply for my mother, and
the memories it gave her hurt. And so the
bracelet was kept until I got it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor Crane asked about Aunt Penelope,
and how she would feel about it, but Mrs. Crane
said she had never believed a word of the tale.
She was my mother’s much older half-sister--my
grandfather first married a Northern woman,
and after she died my mother’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t bother Penelope,” said Mrs. Crane.
And she laughed. And then, Mary Elinor said,
she added: “I wonder how Natalie will get on
there, Ted? I imagine that there is a good deal
of worldliness and thought of form. I do hope
it will be all right, for if she is like her mother
she is a dear!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter V</span>--<span class='sc'>New York and My New Home</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I had</span> a very happy time with the Cranes, and,
although Mary Elinor’s story upset me a little
(in spite of my then not believing it), I was
cheered by the time I left, and entirely myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Crane told me to go play ball with
William, after breakfast. She said I was foolish
to drop it entirely and that she knew Mrs. Bradly
would want me to play if she realized what good
exercise it was. And Doctor Crane said he would
write her. So I played, and after William let
go of two hot ones and said “Ouch!” before
he could suppress it, I felt better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor Crane rooted--for me, and it was all
very happy. And I <span class='it'>did</span> so want to stay! He
and Mary Elinor sat on grapefruit crates and
yelled; Mrs. Crane came to the door now and
again; Lucky, the awfully black little nigger,
climbed up on the laundry roof, and every once
in a while old Aunt Eliza would look out the
window and laugh so that she shook all over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doan that beat <span class='it'>all</span>?” she’d say. “An’
Mistah William droppin’ them balls!” And
then she’d laugh again, and William did too,
although he couldn’t have enjoyed having me
come out on top. But they are all that way.
They really don’t mind discomfort, if other people
are happy, they are so kind!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We scored by making each other drop and
miss balls, but of course the aim had to be square.
The method was the thing. And just as Doctor
Crane was yelling, “<span class='it'>Good</span> grounder, Nat! Now
sock him with a warm baby!” Mrs. Crane
opened the door and said: “Ted, you’ve got
to start.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s almost half-past.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
And I had to put on my hat. I hated to. I
just wish I could have stayed there and had my
education applied!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all went to the station with me except
Mrs. Crane, and Mary Elinor bought me a little
box of mints, and William gave me a glass baseball
bat filled with tiny candies, for a joke.
Then Doctor Crane bought me several magazines,
some of which were <span class='it'>full</span> of baseball stories,
talked to the porter about me (Doctor Crane
somehow got through the gates), and I was off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all the way to New York I was cheered
by the way the Cranes had said good-bye to me.
Mrs. Crane was lovely and, with Mary Elinor,
made me promise to come again; and Doctor
Crane wrote down just what I was to do if I
wasn’t met, beside being awfully good to me,
and William said I <span class='it'>could</span> play ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought about them a lot; about my new
bracelet, and about New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had dinner on the train, which in the North
they call lunch, and got on very well. It wasn’t
difficult, because you wrote down what you
wanted, and I knew exactly what that was. I
ordered lobster, which I had never tasted, ice-cream,
cake, a cream puff, and chocolate with
whipped cream on top of it. A gentleman who
sat opposite me gasped and said: “Oh, <span class='it'>my</span>!”
Then he asked me if I was tired of life. He
seemed impressed with my order, but I don’t
know why. He got zwiebach (he told me what
it was) and soft-boiled eggs and milk. And after
he finished lunch he offered me some pepsin
tablets. He took several, but I refused. And
he said perhaps I was wise, for, he said, he
didn’t know what one little tablet could do against
that line-up. Then he asked me if there were
any ostriches among my ancestors. He was
selling automobile tyres, and called the waiter
George, and seemed to know him very well. And
he told me all about his indigestion, as his eyes
roved over my order. “As for eating a mess
like <span class='it'>that</span>----” he said, and then ended with,
“<span class='it'>Oh</span>, my----” but I cannot quote him entirely,
for it was terrible. It is that word which goes
in church, but which becomes swearing when a
man says it in talking to the umpire. I suppose
this man was in pain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After that we talked
of baseball, and he knew Hans Wagner and had
known him since the beginning of his career,
when he played in the Oil League in Western
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course I was interested. I lingered over
my cream puff, ice-cream, and cake, and he
lingered over his milk. He said he’d look me
up in New York, and I was awfully grateful, and
I said I was sure my aunt would love to have
him come to supper. To which he replied, “Me
for it, kid,” which sounded a little queer to me,
even then. I did not know, at that time, that
you are not supposed to talk to people to whom
you have not been presented, or who have not
been presented to you. I learned that later.
But that belongs in another part of this story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We reached New York when it was just
growing dark, and never in all my life will I
forget the look of it, the dazzling lit-Christmas-trees
look of the tall, bright buildings, and
the hurrying, bright-faced crowds. Everyone
seemed in a hurry, and some people actually ran,
and especially as they crossed Fifth Avenue,
where we drove for some distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My uncle’s chauffeur met me, and he did not
seem very sociable (I had not learned that you
mustn’t talk to them, at that time), and after I
asked him how he was and whether my aunt and
uncle were well and whether they had had
summer colds or hay fever, which is the way we
start acquaintance in Queensburg, I stopped
talking and looked. And I never saw so much
to see before. It is wonderful. It took all my
dreams of fairyland and made them look like a
miffed ball. I looked up, and began to see why
they picture the Reuben type with their mouths
ajar. It is natural to let your chin droop from
surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we almost there?” I asked, after we’d
gone about a million blocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jackson replied, “Not yet, miss,” and stared
straight ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I said: “Well, <span class='it'>isn’t</span> this a long way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said: “Yes, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that I did some more looking.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The dusk had fallen, and it made a lovely haze
around the tops of the buildings, and looking
down the side streets one could see only millions
of motor head-lights, and nothing but those. And
the women were so beautifully dressed! Some
of them, in the passing motors, leaned way back
and looked tired, but beautifully so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not
as the women do around Queensburg. When
they are tired they wear calico wrappers, and
their backs get stooped, and usually there is a
baby clinging to their skirts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But here it
is different. I can’t say why. The women’s
eyes are narrowed as if they <span class='it'>wanted</span> to look tired.
And they are so pretty. “Jackson,” I said, “I
never saw such beautiful complexions”--no, I
said, “Mr. Jackson,” then. And he said:
“Yes, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, after a great way of this we reached a
quieter section, and here, in front of a very tall,
brownstone building, Jackson alighted, and I
followed. A girl, whom I knew to be Evelyn,
came out of a doorway, and said, “Why, what
made you ride up with Jackson?” and then she
turned her cheek for my kiss. And I can’t yet
understand what there was about that which
made me feel so hollow and cold inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she said: “Come in, and we’ll go up.
I don’t think mother’s in, but she will be
soon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope your trip was pleasant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied that it was. But I don’t think she
heard what I said, for we had stepped in an
elevator and she was busy smiling at a man who
leaned on a heavy cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charming day, Mr. Kempwood,” she said.
“You’ve been motoring?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said he had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have too, a bit,” said Evelyn, “but I was
kept in most of this afternoon by a wild bout of
auction. And--I took the prize!” She
showed it to him. It was a beautiful thing, a
little enamelled box on a gold chain, and in it
was a powder-puff, pink powder, and a place
for coins. Even I was impressed with it, and at
that time I knew little beside what the proper
balance of a bat should be. I began to feel
worse and to swallow hard. The man looked
at me in a quizzical way, his eyes narrowed, and
little wrinkles showing at the corners of them.
Then he said good-night and got off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Samuel Kempwood,” said Evelyn, as
we went on (she said this in a low tone so that
the elevator man shouldn’t hear), “has the
apartment on the third floor. <span class='it'>Wonderful</span> collection
of ivories, and is the most <span class='it'>thrillingly</span>
romantic person.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, here we are!”
And then we stepped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, I don’t know what I had expected, but
I know I had not expected a flat, I mean apartment,
like this. It is wonderful. In the first
place, it takes up the whole floor of that great
big building, and doesn’t seem at all crowded.
I had expected folding beds and having to put
your hat on the piano and eat off a card-table,
but it isn’t that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we got off we stepped into a little outer
hall, and Evelyn rang. Then a maid opened
the door, and we went in without speaking to
her. After she took Evelyn’s furs, Evelyn said:
“Is my mother in, Jane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the maid answered with: “Not yet, Miss
Evelyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that Evelyn said, “You had your dinner
on the train?” and I said I had. She didn’t
say anything about supper, and of course I didn’t
understand at that time. But I began to feel
frightfully hollow under my belt. I stood this a
little while, and at last I said: “Could I have
a cup of tea? I don’t like to make any trouble--but----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tea?” she echoed, and raised her eyebrows
as if she were ever so surprised, and then added:
“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she rang a bell. “I didn’t get any
supper,” I explained, “because I thought you’d
be waiting it here for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you meant you’d had your evening
meal,” she said quickly. “It is called dinner
here. You will avoid confusion if you remember
that. Jane, please see that some dinner is put
on for Miss Natalie. She has not dined.” Jane
bowed and left, and I began to feel even more
hollow, and this time it was my heart that felt
that way too. Evelyn moved around humming.
She had been reading a great deal of mail and
casually commenting on it as she read, like this:
“Tuesday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Um, I don’t--know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And does Mrs. Stanwood think I would accept
<span class='it'>her</span> invitation? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And then she would hum
something else. She shakes her voice a great
deal when she sings. She forgot me even more
than she had, and I did feel so alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jane at last came back, Evelyn looked
up and spoke. “Really,” she said, “you must
excuse me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn’t mean to neglect you,
but I had to get through my mail; you know
how it is, of course.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you want to
brush up before you eat? Frightful of me to
forget to ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said all I wanted was to eat, and then Jane
said, “This way, please,” and I followed, sort
of tiptoeing because everything seemed so very
grand, and it all made me seem even shabbier
than I was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dining-room is all panelled in some sort
of dark wood, and has beautifully upholstered
dark furniture in it. Silver gleamed from a long
sideboard, which hasn’t one mirror in it (they
all have mirrors on them in Queensburg), and a
Jap served things. I liked him; he smiled at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were roses and lilies of the valley in a
great silver bowl which stood in the centre of
the table, and I liked those better than anything.
And when I looked at them my eyes
filled. And I guess the Jap man saw it, for he
took out a rose and several sprays of lilies of
the valley and laid them by my place and said,
“Like flowers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Always pretty,” and I
said: “<span class='it'>Can</span> I really have them?” And he
smiled at me again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he got food, and gave me the right
fork, after I had used up the wrong one on the
wrong thing to eat it with, which is mixed, but
as I said, gym. work is where I do well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I had got through, and the Jap had
given me a bowl of water with a flower floating
in it (it confused me then) and was asking me
whether I wanted coffee here or in the drawing-room,
Amy, my cousin who is nearest my age,
came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My <span class='it'>dear</span>,” she said, “I simply hated not
being here to receive you, but it was my dancing-class
afternoon, and afterward I went to dinner
with a friend. I couldn’t in decency refuse her.
I hope your trip was pleasant? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do let us
go in where we can talk comfortably.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Ito,
coffee in the drawing-room, please.) Mother
isn’t in, is she? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Poor mother, so rushed!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But everyone is. We love having you,
Natalie!” And then she slid her arm through
mine and squeezed my hand. And I loved her
from that minute on. For--although we are very
different, and she sometimes seems affected to
me, she is kind. And you can overlook anything
if people are that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn is not. When you humiliate her, she
hurts you to pay it back. I know that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
After the first half-hour of Evelyn, I learned my
first big lesson from New York. And that wasn’t
calling dinner supper; it was that kindness and
making other people feel happy is the most important
thing in life, and the thing that counts
most truly and deeply. I try hard not to err in
this now, for I know how it feels to have people
do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we reached the drawing-room, we found
Evelyn had left. She is twenty-one and “out,”
and she goes to parties a great deal. Amy sat
talking about her and her beaux (she didn’t call
them that), and her engagements, and I sat
trying to look as if I cared a great deal about
what Amy said, but thinking of Uncle Frank,
Bradly-dear, and of Willy Jepson. That night
I was quite sure that Willy Jepson would have a
wife before he was eighteen! But he didn’t.
However, that comes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about ten Amy asked whether I’d like to
go to bed, and I admitted that I was tired, and
so she showed me to the most beautiful little
room near hers, with a bathroom which she and
Evelyn and I were to use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absurd little room we had to give you,
dear,” she said, “but I suppose you can make
out. If you need anything, the button is by the
door, and the electrics turn on here. Anything
I can get you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked her and said no, and then she wished
me happy dreams and left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alone--I looked around. It was the most
beautiful bedroom I had ever seen, but that did
not help me. There was a dressing-table with
three mirrors to it, and long mirrors in all the
doors. There was a table by the bed, with a
telephone on it, under a little lady’s fluffy skirts.
And there was a light on this table too, with a
pink shade from which roses artistically drooped.
There were books by this, and a flashlight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I never dreamed then that I would use that flashlight
as I did later.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The walls were of
brocade, in a rose shade, and the furniture was
gray, with baskets of roses painted on it. And
there was a sort of a lounge on which you could
sit up, but lie down, if you understand, and deep,
cretonne-covered chairs. When you opened the
cupboard door the cupboard lit up, and there
were hangers inside, and it was scented. I went
around touching things very timidly and looking.
And, as I said before, it was the most beautiful
bedroom I ever saw, and at that time frankly
awed me; but--it showed how little <span class='it'>things</span> count.
For I wanted my own, bare-floored little bedroom
with no decoration except two fish-nets and
a mounted eagle, and which held nothing but a
straight-backed chair, a bed, and a bureau with
a wavery mirror.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wanted it terribly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I wanted to hear Uncle Frank “Ho hum” and
to have Mrs. Bradly scold me, when all the time
she was loving me--inside. I wanted to hear
Willy Jepson whistle and yell: “Come on, Nat!
Let’s go fishing!” I wanted <span class='it'>home</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I swallowed hard and began to unpack.
When I found the china cat I held him awfully
close between my hands, and then--when I
found the bug that stays in the ground three
years, I stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to,” I said unsteadily, “for Uncle
Frank and my mother. I’ve got to--and--<span class='it'>I
will</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I set those things on the bureau and
began to undress. I looked at them a lot as I
did. And after I was ready for bed I said my
prayers awfully hard, the way you do when
things go wrong and it is nice to remember that
there is someone who will do His best to right
fouls, if you need it. And then I turned off the
lights and got in bed. I couldn’t sleep. So
after quite a while I got up and fumbled around
to find the Jumel bracelet, Bradly-dear’s cat,
and the bug. And I put them all on the table
by my bed, and then, after I’d touched them
now and again, I slipped into dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I dreamed that Uncle Frank said: “Ho
hum, ho hum! She’s a pretty nice little bug!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter VI</span>--<span class='sc'>The Second Bracelet</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> whole mystery really began the next afternoon.
But I must begin by telling of what happened
in the morning. I got up and met my
aunt. She sent for me, and I went to her room,
where she, dressed in a beautiful négligé, was
eating her breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked a little tired and white, but she
didn’t let herself seem so when she talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child,” she said, “we are so happy
to have you here. Sit down--not there, dear;
that’s a frock I’ve had sent up on approval, and
one doesn’t like to crush them more than so
much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was so sorry I couldn’t meet
you last night, but I was persuaded to stay down-town
and go to see something light with a group
of friends.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So seldom have an evening
free.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not <span class='it'>that</span> blouse, Jane! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now
let me see you, Natalie. Stand up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did so, and she said, “Hum----” in a
lingering, speculative way. I didn’t feel very
comfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we must go shopping,” she said with
a sigh. “Jane, go ask Miss Evelyn to be kind
enough to come here a moment----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane vanished, and my aunt went on looking
me over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some gray mixture for your day frocks, I
think,” she said at length. “With your gray
eyes--yes, gray. And we’ll look at something
soft in rose and in pink for evening.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lovely
hair you have, dear. Like your mother’s. But
it looks more like New Orleans than Virginia. I
wonder whether there <span class='it'>was</span> Creole blood in your
mother’s mother’s family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I didn’t know, and then Evelyn came
in. She spoke to me pleasantly, although carelessly,
and then to her mother. The way she
spoke to her was not pleasant. “What is it?”
she almost whined. “I was right in the middle
of notes, mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted you to telephone Mrs. Lethridge-Guth;
tell her I’m indisposed--can’t play this
morning.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This child will <span class='it'>have</span> to have
some clothes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn looked at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She most certainly <span class='it'>will</span>!” she admitted. “I
should think some of that braid could come off
before you go out----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope nodded, got a scissors, and I
slipped from my frock. Then I sat down and
began to rip off the braid which I had so painfully
attached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear <span class='it'>child</span>,” Evelyn broke out, after a
look at my arm, “where did you get that?
Have you been in my things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hated that last, and I suppose I showed it,
for I know my head went up, and I answered
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” I said, “is the Jumel bracelet, and
it is mine. It belonged to my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost forgotten it,” said Aunt Penelope;
“let’s see the thing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I slipped it off and
handed it to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evelyn’s father had one like this made for
her,” said Aunt Penelope. “He had Tiffany
send a man up to the Jumel Mansion and make
drawings of the mate of this, which is in a case
by the painting. I think Eve is a little annoyed
at your having the real one while hers is a copy.”
And Aunt Penelope looked shrewdly at Evelyn
and laughed a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How <span class='it'>silly</span> of you, mother!” said Evelyn
hotly. “I’m nothing of the sort!” And then
she spoke of the dent in mine, and handed it
back to me. You could see she thought mine
was very unimportant. After that, she asked
some fretful questions about what she should say
at the telephone and left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little out of sorts,” said my aunt, as Jane
came back with her street things; “late hours,
you know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We’ll have to get you something
that you can put on immediately, for there
is a friend of your mother’s coming in to tea,
whom you must see--dear old soul. Not <span class='it'>that</span>
one, Jane.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mercy, my girl, can I never
teach you--no, the <span class='it'>gray</span>----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After my aunt had dressed for forty-five
minutes, she was at last ready to start, and we
did. But we didn’t go down to the shopping
district by motor, for aunt said that took too
long, so we walked a little way and then went
in the subway, which was hot, and that made
everyone look sleepy and yawn. Aunt Penelope
bought me a great many things, and enough
underclothes to change every day! They were
very pretty. And I must say I did enjoy trying
on the soft things I was to wear in the house at
night. There was a white crêpe de chine, with
a broad yellow sash and hand-embroidered
scallops done in yellow around the collar. The
woman who sold us things, who had a beautiful
voice, and who was very polite <span class='it'>and</span> complimentary,
said: “Beautiful with her hair and
skin. The two are a rare combination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And my aunt said: “Yes, let me see that
gray, with the rose girdle----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she bought that too. And then she
bought a rose-coloured dress which was untrimmed
except for broad collars and cuffs of
scrim, and a plain heavy white dress, untrimmed
except for buttons and stitching. And
she bought stockings to match all these. She
selected shoes for me, skirts for me, morning
frocks, as she called them, a motor-coat, a suit,
and several hats, all of which were very plain,
and a squashy black tam made of lovely soft
velvet. I could only gasp. Oh, yes--I almost
forgot. She bought brushes and combs for me
too, and a little tiny brush to brush my eyebrows
with! I almost fainted. And all that
took us quite a while, of course. We had lunch
in the store, but I didn’t enjoy it much, because
my aunt selected it, and naturally it was
nourishing, which always detracts from the
interest of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then we went home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we walked down a side street I saw the
loveliest white house on a hill and realized it
stood only a few blocks from aunt’s. I asked
what it was, and found it was the Jumel
Mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the things had reached home before
we had--those that we bought first--and it was
while I was standing and gazing rapturously at
that pink dress that I saw the note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was scrawled on my telephone pad, and it
said: “Do not wear the Jumel bracelet to-day.
It is my wish that you do not.--E.J.” I read
it two or three times and then I went to the
drawing-room. Jane was dusting, and I asked
her what I wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jane,” I said, “what was Madam Jumel’s
first name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say, miss,” she replied, “but if
she is important, you’ll find her in the New York
Guide, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked her and went to look it up. And I
found that Madam Jumel’s name was Eliza.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I’d heard of spirits writing, but I
hadn’t believed it before; and I really didn’t
believe it then; I thought it was a joke. But
I decided I would go over to the Jumel Mansion
for a few moments if my aunt would let me. I
felt as if I must. So I asked her, and she said
I might--for “just a little while.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I put
on my new suit and the tam (which I had worn
home), defiantly clasped that bracelet around my
arm, and started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when I got there I found that it was open
and that anyone might go in, so I did, and I did
enjoy it! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the first place, it is a lovely
old house, and it has in it everything in the way
of interesting relics that you can imagine. It
was Washington’s headquarters for more than
a month during the Revolution, and the room
where he slept especially interested me. It
proved to me that good deeds don’t die. For
Washington, who did lots of them, is remembered
because he always did his best and was
upright and fine and true. And now--every
little thing that he even touched is kept and
treasured. I stood looking at the Washington
relics for a long time, and then one of the
curators asked me whether I would like to see
the door through which the Indian braves came
to pledge allegiance to Washington, and I said
I would. So he showed it to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through this,” he said, “they trooped in;
soft-footed, I suppose they were, since they all
wore moccasins; and they carried laurel branches
as an outward sign of the tune of their
spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he told me that the British occupied
the house later--they captured it November 16,
1776, to be exact--but he said there was no soft-footed
approach with them. He said they were
a noisy crowd who liked their ale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Perhaps they were homesick and
had to do something to cheer themselves up.”
I could understand <span class='it'>that</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” he said, “perhaps they were!”
and he smiled at me. Then he asked me if I
was from the South. He said he rather noticed
it in my voice, and he smiled again. I told him
yes, and then I thought perhaps he would be
interested in my bracelet, and so I showed it to
him, and my! the confusion that ensued! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He called everyone else who took care of the
house, and they all came, and I had to tell my
story at least six separate times, and quite an
interested crowd of visitors listened and looked
at it too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I simply told them how it came
to me, and not about the tragic happenings that
it made, for at that time I had made up my
mind I would not believe in that tale!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, we stood around talking and then we
went over to the painting of Madam Jumel, and
near that I saw the bracelet she had kept. It
was in a little case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great many people admire that,” said
one of the women who stayed there, “especially
the women. There was a little Spanish woman
in here the other day who was simply mad about
it. All she could say was, ‘Es incomparable
lindo y yo lo deseo!’ ” which the man said
meant: “Incomparably beautiful! How greatly
do I desire it! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She said that men liked
the Washington things best, but that women
almost always liked the bracelet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, because it was growing late, I knew I
must go, although I hated to. The people who
took care of the house all asked me to come
soon again, and I said I would, for I liked them
and the house. And, after good-byes and a
promise to return and show them the bracelet
again, I hurried off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And outside it began.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t know how
you know that you are being followed, but I did
then. And suddenly--I heard soft, scuddy footsteps
drawing closer to me at every second.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I ran, and then--I stopped, for I meant to be
brave and face it, and I give you my word,
although not a second before I had heard those
hurrying feet, when I turned there was no one
in sight except an old man, who was sitting on
the kerb and holding out a tin cup. He wore
dark glasses, so I knew he was blind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
went back to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you,” I asked, and foolishly, I realized
afterward, “see anyone pass?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am blind,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I said that I knew that was silly to
say and that I was sorry. And I gave him
fifteen cents, which was all I had with me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I went on, and I began to hear those footsteps
again, coming closer and closer--and then ahead
of me I saw the man that Evelyn said was “romantically
thrilling,” and I ran for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone,” I gasped, “is following me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped and looked down, and I saw that
he didn’t recognize me, and then he looked back,
as I had, and saw nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no one in sight,” he said soothingly,
“and I’m sure there’s nothing to be
frightened about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not,” I answered, “but if you are
going home, I’ll go with you.” And then I told
him that I was Evelyn’s cousin, and when he
said he hadn’t recognized me I told him my aunt
had bought me a lot of new clothes. And I told
him quite a little about them, because he was
sympathetic and easy to talk to. He is a little
lame and has to use a cane all the time, and
somehow his being not just like other people
makes you want to be kind to him; and that--or
something else--has made him very kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we turned in the apartment-house I saw
the blind man going along the other side of the
street, his cane doing the feeling for him, and
his movements awkward and stiff. There are a
great many things that are sad in New York,
which seems strange, for so many people are so
wealthy. Now, in Queensburg no one has much
money, but no one could go in want, for the
people who have just a little more than they
have wouldn’t let them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told Mr. Kempwood a little about Queensburg
too, and he was really interested. And that
helped me, for not even Amy will listen to that.
He rode up to our floor with me, and stepped
off to wait until I got in. Then he shook hands
and said good-bye. As he rang for the elevator
he said: “If that hat is one of the new ones,
you did well. It’s a corker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked him and admitted it had some sense,
for you could keep it on if you wanted to make
a home run. He said I seemed to be doing that
when we met, and then the elevator came and
he went down. And I went in, remembering his
smile so hard that I almost forgot about being
followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My mother’s friend was there, and I liked her,
and I enjoyed the tea, although Aunt Penelope
suppressed my natural tendency to engulf cakes
and indicated thin bread and butter sandwiches.
Then Amy came in, and I went with her to dress.
Aunt told me to bathe and put on one of my
soft frocks, and to do that each evening at the
same hour; but not to wear one frock continually,
simply because I liked it. I said I wouldn’t,
and decided to wear the pink one every <span class='it'>other</span>
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I slipped off the bracelet and laid it on my
bureau. When I was bathing I heard a little
noise, but I didn’t pay much attention to it. I
thought that Amy had come in my room to get
a pin, or to borrow some hairpins. She uses
invisible ones to make her hair look curlier
around her face. But when I got out and was
doing my hair I saw another note. It lay where
my bracelet had been. On it was written:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you not to wear this. My warnings
are not given without reason. When I deem it
wise this will be returned.--E. J.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter VII</span>--<span class='sc'>Real Excitement</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>If</span> the bracelet had not been gone I would have
thought I imagined everything of the afternoon
before, but when morning light and a real search
revealed no trace of it, I believed I had been
followed and had heard those footsteps drawing
closer and closer to me as I ran. And it did
not make me comfortable. I wondered what to
do all morning, and after reflection decided not
to speak of it to my cousins, aunt, or uncle (my
uncle I had met the night before; he had just
come in from a business trip), for somehow I
knew they would not believe it, and I didn’t want
them to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Uncle Archie has a great big stomach and
says “Huh?” if anyone speaks to him, which
they don’t often. He eats a great deal, and tells
Ito to “hurry up.” He said something about
bills to Aunt Penelope. They don’t seem to be
very congenial. But he can talk, for I heard
him at the telephone. “Sold it <span class='it'>to-day</span>!” he
simply yelled; then, “Fools! I’ll teach ’em!
I’ll--the----” and he simply spluttered. It was
becoming interesting when Aunt Penelope said,
“Ito, close the door,” and, of course, when Ito
did, the rest was lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was sorry, but Amy only looked bored.
Evelyn, after having tea with us, had gone out
to a dinner dance. Aunt Penelope at tea told
the other women what a great treat it was to
have Evelyn at home. She did it a great many
times, and it almost seemed as if she wanted
them to know that Evelyn went out a great deal,
although why she didn’t say it outright, if she
did want them to know, I don’t see. But that’s
the way a great many people in New York act.
They sort of sidle around back of the truth and
shout around it--about the weather. Which I
think is silly. Well, to get on. After dinner
Amy and I sat. I never have done so much
sitting as I have done since coming to New York.
The chairs and davenports are so luxurious they
just must be sat on or curled up in. Amy and
I each have our pet arm-chair and way of sitting
in it. But this is beside the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found that Amy had never done any hazing.
And she was much interested in my accounts of
it. I told her how we had had a secret society
called “The Ancient and Effervescent Order of
Yellow Pups,” and how we made the new
members get down on all fours and chew at a
ham-bone, and she honestly giggled. And then
I told her how Willy Jepson had filled his aunt’s
bedroom slippers full of tar, and she was interested
in that and a description of how his aunt
acted when she slipped her feet in the slippers.
You see, she was still half asleep and sort of
blinky, the way you are in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would we haze?” she asked. I suggested
Evelyn. And not alone because I wanted
to, but because I thought she honestly needed
it. I decided it would do wonders for her
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How would we do it?” Amy next asked,
and I suggested the “cold bottle trick,” which
is simple, but satisfactory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You take a bottle and fill it with cold water,
the colder the better. And if you can get ice in
it, that adds a great deal. Then you tie a ribbon
around the cork, awfully tight, and pin the other
end of the ribbon to the bottom of the mattress,
and the bottle, then in place and at the foot of
some dear friend’s bed, awaits. When their feet
hit it, they naturally reach down and pull, and
when they do it uncorks and the puller wades.
And I can tell you, it is one thing to wade in
the babbling brook, and another to wade in an
Ostermoor! Willy Jepson put green paint in
the bottle he put in his brother’s bed, and his
brother looked like the first note of spring for
weeks, but we decided that wouldn’t do for
Evelyn, because the sort of stockings she wears
show the colour of her skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy said people would comment on it if her
ankles were green, and I believed it. “We
could blame it on Jane,” said Amy. I didn’t
think that was fair, until she explained. It seems
Jane is exceptional because she is willing to be
a parlourmaid and help Aunt Penelope dress too,
which combination is not often found. “Mother
wouldn’t think of dismissing her,” said Amy,
“so that would be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I agreed. Then Amy told me that they were
bitterly poor and lived like paupers, and my chin
did drop! And she went on to say that her
mother encouraged her father to make money
<span class='it'>all</span> the time, but that he didn’t make nearly all
that they really needed, now that Evelyn was
out and had to have about sixty costumes to the
minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I just listened. It was the only thing to do.
But I thought too! And I decided that it is <span class='it'>bad</span>
to want <span class='it'>things</span> so much. And that it is especially
easy for a girl to do, and so it is well to guard
against it. Here was my cousin Evelyn with
this lovely home, and simply beautiful clothes--wanting
more and fretting because she can’t
have them. And my aunt hurrying my uncle so
that he hasn’t time or energy left to do anything
but eat and say “Huh?” when he’s at home,
and Amy--being sorry for herself because she
hasn’t all the pretty things that her wealthiest
friend has. And I saw that wanting was just a
habit, and a bad one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I think it would be a fine thing for
you to take account of stock, Amy, and count
all the lovely things you <span class='it'>have</span>. Maybe you’d
feel better.” But she said: “I haven’t time;
I’m too busy thinking of the things I
<span class='it'>haven’t</span>----” And the whole trouble lay right
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, as I said, we talked a lot, played the
victrola a little, and then we got a long-necked
mint-sauce bottle from the cook and fixed
Evelyn’s bed. And then we turned in, or, as
Miss Hooker would say, “retired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I thought, as I always do, about Uncle
Frank and Bradly-dear, and the Cranes, Willy
Jepson, and baseball. But I went to sleep feeling
less badly than I had the night before, for I felt
confident that the bracelet would come back to
me, and somehow Mr. Kempwood had made me
less afraid, and home seemed nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn found that bottle. I never heard such
a noise. She said someone was trying to murder
her! And everyone got up except Amy and
me. We giggled until Aunt Penelope came in
and said, “Does either of <span class='it'>you</span> know anything
about this?” (Amy had come over in my bed),
and then Amy said, “Maybe Jane did it,” but
her mother didn’t seem convinced. She only
said, “I will attend to <span class='it'>you</span> two in the morning!”
and she said it sternly. When she went out we
giggled some more. It was impossible to help,
for Evelyn’s room is near ours, and we could
hear her gasp and threaten to sit up all night,
and then sort of hiccup and say she thought
she was getting hysterics and that she hoped her
mother would beat <span class='it'>me</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And we could hear
Aunt Penelope and Jane flop around and bells
ring and hot drinks ordered, and all because
Evelyn’s feet were a little wet, which was irrational,
since she puts them in the tub at least
once every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Uncle Archie said to me much later,
“There is no reasoning with a woman,” and
there is a lot in that statement. We giggled
until Aunt Penelope returned, when we pretended
to be asleep. I hoped the way we looked in
sleep would soften her, but it didn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was in disgrace until about seven the next
evening, but that comes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning I will pass over hurriedly,
as it was not pleasant. Aunt talked to us frankly,
and Amy put the blame on me, where it belonged.
But I would have liked her better if she’d let
me step forward and <span class='it'>take</span> it, as I intended to.
“You know it <span class='it'>was</span> your fault,” she said, after
we went out of her mother’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I knew it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said, “you needn’t be annoyed
because I <span class='it'>said</span> so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wasn’t annoyed. I was sorry that she was
so poor a sport, but I wasn’t angry. I pitied
her. I think you always feel sorry for a person
when they don’t play the best game they can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because Amy had failed to stick to fair rules,
I didn’t care so much for her that day, and I
suppose because she dimly felt that she’d failed,
she avoided me; so, after lunch, I asked aunt
if I might go walking. She said yes, if I was
careful not to get lost, adding that she would
rather not have me leave the immediate neighbourhood.
I said I wouldn’t, and then I started
out. I put on the tam again because it sticks
and doesn’t have to have pins. And then Mr.
Kempwood said it was becoming. I will acknowledge
that that influenced me a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I’d walked around several blocks and
seen nothing but the same sort of houses and
pavements and babies, all with nurses, I turned
toward the Jumel Mansion. And again the
people who take care of it were kind to me, and
I enjoyed my visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I learned some more about the place. It
seemed the French merchant, Stephen Jumel,
did not build it, but Roger Morris, then loyal
servant of the King, built it for his wife, seven
years after they were married. Before she became
Mrs. Morris she was Mary Philipse, nicknamed
“The Charming Polly.” He built it
well and strongly, which was fortunate, since it
was to have so many inmates and so much wear.
When you think of it, a house that was put up
in 1765 and 1766 would have to be splendidly
made to stand the years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Charming Polly” must have been indeed
charming, for her descendants say that
Washington, who was, just before her marriage,
a man of twenty-five, offered her his hand and
name, but from the look of things it would
not seem so. For a friend of Washington’s,
Joseph Chew, wrote him that Captain Roger
Morris, who was a “lady’s man, always something
to say,” was breakfasting often with
Mistress Philipse, and that the “town talk’t of
it as a sure &amp; settled affair,” and he added an
urgent appeal for Washington to return, as he
was sure Charming Mistress Polly must prefer
Washington to all others.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But perhaps
Washington had found another “Charming”
somebody, for the letter of July brought no visit
from Washington until late one winter’s eve,
when, the descendants of Mary Philipse say, he
“arrived post haste, and demanded an interview
immediate, notwithstanding that the hour was
late.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, whether or not it was more than a
flirtation or a light admiration, it does seem
strange, does it not, that Washington should
direct his army from the house that his rival
built for the much-admired and talked-of Mistress
Polly Philipse?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Philipse and Captain Morris were
married in 1758. They had four children, two
boys and two girls, if I recall correctly what I
was told; and when General Washington took
command at Cambridge, they had been married
for seventeen years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, to me there is something unsatisfactory
about a man who doesn’t take sides, and Captain
Morris didn’t. In fact, the builder of that lovely
house evaded siding with either the British or
the United States, at the time of the Revolution,
and one day while the mails were being
taken aboard <span class='it'>The Harriet Packet</span> he quietly
slipped aboard with John Watts, who, with
Roger Morris, was a member of His Majesty’s
Council for this province. Together they sailed
for England, and Captain Morris remained
abroad for almost two years. And unhappy years
they were too, for he was homesick for the big
white house, his lovely wife and children. (And
I can understand the first, although no one who
hadn’t lived in it would think that Uncle Frank’s
house was lovely.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rumour states that Captain Roger Morris
took rooms in “London Town,” so to be nearer
the mails of the ships, that his wife’s letters
would come to him without delay.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
can you see him waiting for those, wanting them,
and looking for the crosses that his girls and
boys wrote at the bottom of the letter? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
am sure they were there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps his
littlest girl wrote, “For my dearest father, whom
I do so greatly love.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dear kisses,” and,
of course, one of every doubled <span class='it'>s</span> was written
like an <span class='it'>f</span>, for that is the way they did it in that
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can you see it? The little girl in quaint, long
frock, painfully writing out a message, while her
mother looked on and wondered whether the
“dearest father” would ever reach home? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The letters he wrote her were lovely, but I didn’t
see those that day. Mr. Kempwood showed me
those after he began to teach me to <span style='font-size:smaller'>SEE</span> history.
For history, he says, is not a dead thing although
it is about dead people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All you have to
do is to remember that they <span style='font-size:smaller'>LIVED</span>, just as we
do, and to shut your eyes, not to think dates
<span class='it'>most</span> important, and to remember those people
as <span class='it'>living</span>. And he taught me to do that. But
that comes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, after I’d learned quite a little bit about
the Morrises and had felt ever so glad that he
did get back, the man who had so kindly told
me these things had to leave me, and I was alone.
I wandered over to stand before Madam Jumel’s
portrait.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And here, I leaned forward and
whispered to her, and I said: “Won’t you <span class='it'>please</span>
return it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My mother wore it. Won’t
you, <span class='it'>please</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I went out and turned toward home.
I saw the blind man again, but no one followed
me. I went up in the elevator with Mr. Kempwood,
and I was so glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any more home runs?” he asked. I shook
my head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how does New York please you?” he
asked further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to that I replied that it was all right, but
made an involved living, since my aunt insisted
on my changing my clothes all the way through
every day, and eating in a different dress at
night. I said it was simpler at home, where you
dressed for dinner when you got up. I told him
it left you more time for fishing and baseball and
the more serious things of life. He laughed, and
then looked suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young woman,” he said, “that country
bloom doesn’t hide a brain-picker, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I didn’t understand him then, but he explained.
It seemed that Robert Louis Stevenson
had lived on an island in the Pacific, and when
someone had asked whether they dressed for
dinner, he had said just as I did: “No, we dress
when we get up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I hadn’t quoted, and that I hadn’t read
Stevenson, liking Alger best of anyone, but
Mr. Kempwood said that “Treasure Island”
couldn’t be beaten and that he’d loan it to me,
and then I found out what he meant by brain-picker.
He meant someone who pikes. Evelyn
reads book covers and reviews and then talks of
the books as if she’d read them. I told Mr.
Kempwood so. He said she wouldn’t thank me
for doing so, and then--it was our floor, and
again he stepped out, waited until Jane opened
the door, and then said good-night. And I remembered
his smile, as I had the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a long hall table I found a letter from
Bradly-dear, and I was <span class='it'>so</span> glad to see it! And
it made me laugh, but felt ever so tight in my
throat too. Here is what she wrote, or some
of it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Natalie</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We miss you fierce. Willy Jepson run
a nail in his foot and fell offa the back ruf. Don’t
you climb no fences at your aunt’s or ride a
cow if they keep one. Your uncle is deep in
bugs and has a mess of them in my tubs, with
netting over the top. And the Lord knows when
I will get the wash to soak. We miss you.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There was a lot more. Bradly-dear had been
fine about writing the news. I went to my room
with it, sat down, and then got up and went
over to Amy’s, for my radiator had cooled off
and I didn’t know how to turn it on. It was
not easy for me to ask servants to do things
then; I had not learned how.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I read
that letter a great many times, and there was
no one to interrupt me, and I was glad. Everyone
but Evelyn was out, and she was lying
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere I heard a clock strike seven and
realized they would soon be in and that I must
begin to change my clothes for dinner. I heard
a little noise in my room, a little, scratching
noise, and I got up and looked in, but no one
was there. Then I heard a noise in Amy’s room,
but, going back there, I found that empty. I
turned on all the lights and read Bradly-dear’s
letter again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I felt curiously nervous and
oppressed. Quite as if I were breathing something
poisonous.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And my heart began to
pump. I thought I was simply letting myself
be silly from nervousness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “You silly
thing!” I said scornfully. And I read the end
of Mrs. Bradly’s letter. It said: “Now, dearie,
I must stop. I love you and I pray God for
your safety and happiness.” And then: “Yours
sincerely, Mrs. G. N. Bradly.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It helped
me a lot, that about loving and praying. I
looked at it, and then I <span class='it'>did</span> hear something;
there was a step behind me and a voice, a high-pitched
voice, said very slowly: “Do not
turn. You will be sorry if you turn. Do <span class='it'>not
turn</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” I didn’t. I couldn’t. I was
absolutely frozen. I felt something drop over
my face, and then things began to swim and
grow black.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think I struggled a little
and tried to scream, but I am not sure of anything
but horror--and the horror I felt at that
moment will live in my soul until I am an old,
old woman, and am allowed to forget all the
things that hurt me and to have another start.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII</span>--<span class='sc'>Again Awake</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> I was again aware of living I heard things
hazily, quite as if there were a thick wall between
me and the voices of the people who stood so
anxiously bending over me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, Archie, the child was <span class='it'>strangled</span>,”
I heard Aunt Penelope say. “And Heaven only
knows what may happen next, with all the
Bolsheviki around--can’t you do something
(Amy, put down that revolver, you are driving
me crazy!)--and Evelyn, right in the next room,
hearing nothing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And said she wasn’t
asleep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Amy, if you don’t sit down I will
scream! And Ito, right in the pantry, by the
fire-escape, on which he must have climbed (if
it was a he), and how he got up I don’t know.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And you say there’s no danger, doctor?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The only child of my <span class='it'>dear</span> dead sister,
and what will happen next? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The only
thing, of course, is to remain <span class='it'>calm</span> (Amy, can’t
you stop wiggling? There <span class='it'>are</span> limits.), and I
suppose to maintain calm is the only sensible
proceeding---- <span class='it'>What was that?</span>” She
screamed the last, and I sat up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor was almost rude about telling her
to be quiet. And then he ordered them all out
and sat down on the edge of my bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyone you especially want to see?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I didn’t think so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better not sit with your back to the
window,” I advised. Then he took hold of my
hand. “There is no danger in windows,” he
said in a level, awfully sure voice. “What hurt
you won’t hurt you again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And he said
it so that I believed him at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now about someone to sit with you to-night.
The ladies, it seems, all have engagements, and
I’ve urged them to keep them. Thought the
normal might give them a balance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll be all right,” I answered. “Jane
can look in once in a while.” But without meaning
to I looked at the window. The doctor
frowned, and I was ashamed. I told him about
how I had been chased and that that had upset
me a little. And that I was usually brave. He
said he thought I was splendid, and that he
wasn’t angry with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sam Kempwood who helped you out of that
scrape?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bully chap,” he said. “I know him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought he was one of the nicest men
that I’d ever met. That you could tell it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose he comes up and plays nurse?”
the doctor suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I smiled. “That would be lovely,” I
admitted after a long breath, for even then I
really loved Mr. Kempwood, “but I am sure it
will bore him. You see, I don’t know how to
entertain people the way my cousin Evelyn
does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the doctor said that <span class='it'>I</span> was to be entertained,
and that he’d stop at Mr. Kempwood’s
on the way down. And then he wrapped me up
in a pink comforter and carried me out to the
living-room, where he put me on a wide lounge
which stands before the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Hannah, or Molly, or whatever your
name is,” he said to Jane, “you stay with this
child until I come back.” And Jane did, but
she wasn’t much help. She was so awfully
frightened and kept jumping and looking around.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In just a few moments the bell rang, and
I heard the men in the hall.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Just a little
while will change the trend and help her,” the
doctor said. “The rest have cleared out and
good riddance! Weren’t any good.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Awfully decent of you, Kempwood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it,” said Mr. Kempwood;
“hadn’t anything to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t make a long business of it,”
said the doctor; “just a few moments will help.
The child’s evident admiration for you led me to
think that you could help her most.” And then
they stopped talking and tiptoed in. I smiled
at Mr. Kempwood and tried to tell him how
grateful I was to him for coming up, but it was
not easy to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind about that,” he said gently.
And then he sat down by me, and showed me
some pictures which I couldn’t see very well,
because my sight was so blurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose,” he said, “we’re quiet----”
And I nodded. And then he took hold of my
hand and patted it, and it helped a great deal.
And I don’t know how it happened, but, somehow,
I was telling him how I had hated coming
to New York, how I missed Uncle Frank and
Bradly-dear, and about the cricket that stays in
the earth for three years. Then my eyes filled--I
could feel them--and I whispered: “It’s only
been <span class='it'>three days</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My <span class='it'>dear</span> child!” he answered, and I could
see he was awfully sorry for me. He patted
terribly hard. That helped too, but it made me
smile. After that one tear slipped over the edge,
and, because I hadn’t a handkerchief, he wiped
it off with his. I thanked him very much, and
then I said: “I don’t ever cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I see,” he answered, and he smiled, but
so gently that I didn’t mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “I don’t really. That is, not when
I’m well. I hadn’t before to-night for ages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t to-night,” he answered, and so
cheerfully. “ ‘One swallow doesn’t make a
summer,’ so certainly one tear doesn’t make a
cry!” And I was so glad he thought I hadn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you want to cry hard,” I confided
further, “swallowing very quickly again and
again will stall it. It’s a great help----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said: “You little <span class='it'>sport</span>!” And I
began to feel happier. He looked at me so
nicely, it warmed me up, and my throat began
to feel better. I asked him when he had to go,
and he said not until I was so sick of him that
I would have Jane throw him out. Then again
we were quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he said after a few moments,
“don’t you like baseball?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded as hard as my stiff throat would
let me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he went on, “don’t you think your
aunt would let you go to the big games with me
next year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat up. “Oh,” I said, “if she <span class='it'>only</span>
would!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see that she will. But that’s a long
way off. We’ll have to have good times before
<span class='it'>that</span>. Ever been to the Hippodrome?” I said
I hadn’t, and he described it. I became very
interested, for it sounded like a sort of glorified
circus. I had to lie down again, for I began
to feel dizzy and sick, but he went right on talking
of it as he arranged the pillows for me and
made me comfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I thought of the bracelet and asked for
Jane. Mr. Kempwood rang, and she came. I
told her I wanted a white satin box that stood
on my bureau, and asked her please to get it.
When she brought it back I held it for several
minutes without opening it, and then I shut my
eyes and felt. The bracelet was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I put it on, and then after a little interval I
told Mr. Kempwood the whole story. I couldn’t
talk loudly, but he leaned over and got it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear child,” he said, “that’s utter nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at it and shook my head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it to me,” he said; “I have a wall
safe, and I’ll take charge of it for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head. “You said you’d take me
to the league games,” I answered. “I’m not
going to run any risks!” And then we both
laughed. He did some more urgings, but I did
not give in, for I knew that it was my battle,
and I meant to fight it out. I didn’t think I
could ever hold up my head if I evaded it, and
then--I couldn’t bear the idea of its hurting Mr.
Kempwood. I told him so. “And not entirely
because of those games,” I admitted honestly,
“but because I like you, a great deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered me quickly. “Natalie,” he
said (I had told him my name as I related the
story of the bracelet), “let’s be friends. For
I like you too, and,” he added after a pause,
“a great deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That began my friendship with Mr. Kempwood,
which helped me in so many ways and
came to mean so much.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter IX</span>--<span class='sc'>A Strange Happening</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A week</span> went by and not much happened. And,
while I was not actively unhappy, I was never
once happy. Amy had lots to do, and I didn’t
see her often, and of course Evelyn was hardly
in at all, and, when she rarely was, she was too
cross to talk to. I wondered about her, as I
had about Uncle Archie--whether the return
paid for what they both gave up? For Evelyn
was tired and strained and losing all her sweetness,
and Uncle Archie had lost all his talk. I
came to feel that it wasn’t worth while in either
case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought a great deal those days. Thought
is almost forced upon you, if you aren’t a social
success, or can’t play baseball. You see, in
such case, there is nothing to divert you and
keep you from reflection. So, I thought. I
also wrote home often and sent Willy Jepson
post-cards, because he sent me one of the gaol,
on which he had written: “My room is marked
with a cross.” (There was a cross over the
only window that is barred.) And he also sent
me a picture of Miss Hooker, taken, I imagine,
in 1892, on which he had written: “She has
consented to be mine! Sweet love has bloomed
within my heart at last!” But I knew he got
that out of a book, because it didn’t sound like
Willy. Those, with a letter from Uncle Frank,
which contained much information about the
larvæ of the bee, cheered me greatly. The
letter sounded so like Uncle Frank that all I had
to do was to shut my eyes, and then I could
hear him “Ho hum.” And I did that quite a
good deal as I re-read his letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That week was, I found afterward, a normal
week for my aunt and cousins and uncle, but
it seemed frightfully hurried to me. Everyone
had decided that I had been choked and chloroformed
by a sneak thief, and after uncle
muttered about speaking to the building’s owner
about the fire-escapes, and aunt’s warning Ito
and Jane about the pantry window, and one of
mine (which opens on an iron balcony, as does
one of Amy’s), everyone forgot the episode. It
seemed Evelyn once lost a fur coat that way,
and that upstairs thieving was not uncommon.
But I knew they were wrong. However,
nothing strengthened my belief until the event
which came in the first part of the following week.
But that comes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I said, the week dragged by. I lived
through it very slowly (it is strange how time is
affected by the way <span style='font-size:smaller'>YOU</span> feel, isn’t it?), and
at last it was Friday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My aunt was going out to a luncheon, and
because I had been alone all morning and
wanted company, I followed her to the hall,
and there we found Mr. Kempwood’s letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Aunt Penelope, “what a
stunning hand, and what a charming shade for
letter paper.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For you. Do let’s see whom
it’s from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I opened it, feeling excited. It was from Mr.
Kempwood, and he asked if I would come down
and have tea with him at four o’clock on Saturday,
and he said that if I liked we would afterward
take a drive. My aunt said I most
certainly could, and then she kissed me with
unusual interest, and left. And I took the letter
and read it three more times, especially the end,
where he had written: “And it is with genuine
pleasure and great pride, my dear Miss Natalie,
that I sign myself your friend, Samuel Kempwood.”
I did like that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, I went in my room, and thought about
all the things I would wear, and I hoped so much
that my aunt would let me wear my pink dress,
but she didn’t. However, I had such a good
time that my disappointment was soon forgotten.
I decided I would wear my jewellery, which consists
of the Jumel bracelet and a ring with a
silver skull on it which Willy Jepson gave me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought my tam would be best for motoring,
because it sticks on and Mr. Kempwood
likes it. And I meant to accept that part of
the invitation very hard, because I love it, and
there never seems to be enough room in aunt’s
motor. Everyone is always sorry, but someone
else always has to go. Amy has so many
friends that it is difficult to pay them all sufficient
attention. This week she took them motoring
each morning--different sets--and deeply regretted
she couldn’t take me. But I understood
how it was, and said so. I tried to make her
just as comfortable as I could about it. They
are all being very kind to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Evelyn had dinner at home; Uncle
Archie was there too, and it might have been
nice if they’d acted so. But aunt sighed a great
deal and said Evelyn <span class='it'>needed</span> a new fur coat and
that there was a beauty on Fifth Avenue for
only twenty-two hundred (and she made a long
lecture about getting good things when you
bought, because they lasted and it really was
an <span class='it'>economy</span>), and then Amy began to whine and
say that if Evelyn had a new coat she didn’t
see why she, Amy, couldn’t have one, and that
she felt like a pauper when she went to school.
I felt sorry for Uncle Archie. He didn’t seem
to mind, but I think it must have bothered him.
After he said “Huh” a few times he turned to
me and really spoke to me for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do <span class='it'>you</span> want?” he asked. “Must
<span class='it'>want</span> something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I said I didn’t. And I added that I was
grateful for all the lovely things aunt had bought
me. I told him that they were beautiful. He
looked at me hard, said “Huh!” and went on
eating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I asked aunt if I could wear the pink
dress to Mr. Kempwood’s party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kempwood’s?” echoed Evelyn, and
she did not seem pleased when her mother told
her about it. “I think that’s very <span class='it'>kind</span> of him,”
she said, after her mother finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Archie went out after dinner, and Evelyn
went to a dance with some friends at about nine;
and Aunt Penelope, sighing and saying thank
Heaven she actually had an evening free, wrote
a lot of notes, and telephoned friends, making
engagements for all the evenings of the next
week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy and I went to bed at nine-thirty because
we are supposed to at nine. Amy sleeps with
me now, because she thinks I may be
frightened. At least, that is what she <span class='it'>says</span>, but
I, privately, think she is scared to be alone.
However, that is not vital. After we got in bed
Amy told me that lots of men had proposed to
Evelyn, but that she had “scorned them all.”
However, she said that there was a man in the
next house whom Evelyn really liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s dippy about him,” Amy said. “You
can see it. They both simper and act silly when
they meet, and they have a basket strung
between the houses on a wire (you know they’re
ever so close), and they pass notes that way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honestly?” I said. It didn’t sound like
Evelyn. She seems too hard for anything
romantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honestly,” Amy assured me. “She doesn’t
think anyone will notice the wire, and the basket
is hidden under her window-box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” I said, and I did. There are flower-boxes
on the outsides of a good many of the
windows. It would be easy enough to manage
to make one a garage for her basket mail-carrier,
if she wanted to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’d die if anyone knew it,” Amy confided.
“It would fuss her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just can’t
imagine Evelyn mooning around in the dark,
waiting for that basket to slide across. I’m
dying to get one of those notes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t it be funny to fill that basket full
of cold flour paste,” I said. “Just think how
she’d jump, if she slid her hand in it--up to the
wrist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t she!” agreed Amy, and giggled.
“But of course we mustn’t,” she added in a
sobered tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” I said, adding: “She
couldn’t tell on us, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Amy. “But we mustn’t let that
influence us. Where could we get the paste?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suggested that we ask the cook to let us
make candy Saturday night. Then we giggled
a good deal. And after that Amy said “darn”
awfully hard, and got out of bed growling and
fussing terribly, for she’d forgotten to say her
prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning when I got up I found my
bracelet was gone, and I was upset by it, and
disappointed, because I had wanted to wear it
down to Mr. Kempwood’s. I decided to ask
Madam Jumel to return it again, although the
recollection of the way it came back before made
me so frightened that my palms grew damp,
even though my hands were cold. But I did
want it. Even at that time I had made up my
mind I would win. For Madam Jumel had given
it to us; it was ours, and she had no right to
make everyone miserable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So--at about three-thirty I went over to the
Jumel Mansion. I asked which room Madam
Jumel slept in, this time, and they told me. I
went up to stand at the door. Some visitors
went past me talking of the room where Lafayette
had slept and of Washington’s bedroom, but
neither Washington nor Lafayette interested me
that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” I whispered, “it isn’t <span class='it'>fair</span>.
You gave it to her, and since you <span class='it'>did</span>----” And
then I stopped, for one of the curators came by
and heard me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absorbing the habit from one of the old
mistresses?” he asked. I didn’t know what he
meant, and he explained. It seemed Madam
Jumel’s mind had wavered as she grew older,
and she did strange things, among them--talking
to herself of the great people she had entertained
and the power she had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely mad,” said the gentleman, whom
I had come to know well in those few visits.
“Why, she employed a lot of French refugees
who were out of work and would take any--starving,
I suppose--brought them up here, and
drilled them as her army. Boys who were fishing
on the other side of the river would look up
to see the old woman heading a little crowd of
ragged men, who carried sticks for guns. She
always rode a horse, sitting erect, and now and
again they said she would turn proudly to survey
her troops.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was a queer one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They say”--he paused and looked in the room--“that
she haunts this room. I don’t believe in
such things, but her relatives who lived here
afterward (three families, they were) swore that
she came back to rap so hard that the walls
shook.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They all quarrelled, and none
spoke to each other; but having no money,
while they waited for the will to be settled, they
lived here; the Nelson Chase family, the Will
Chase family, and the Pérys. The Chases were
her nephews, Mrs. Péry her niece. Mademoiselle
Nitschke, the governess of small
Mathilde Péry, did not believe in ghosts, but--one
night even she was convinced.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You’ll
find all that story in a book called ‘The Jumel
Mansion,’ which Mr. William Henry Shelton,
whom you have seen here, wrote.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hunted Mr. Shelton, and he showed me this.
I won’t quote it entire, but only in part. It is
in his book, as Mademoiselle Nitschke told it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to live at the Mansion three years
after Madam Jumel died, or about 1868. My
room was on the third floor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After a little
time I was moved down to the Lafayette Room,
to be nearer Mrs. Péry, who was in nightly terror
of the ghost of Madam Jumel, which, she
claimed, came with terrible rappings between
twelve and one o’clock, or about midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Péry would come to my room in the
night in great excitement to escape the ghost.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One night she insisted on my coming to
their bedroom and awaiting the ghost. I had
always told them there was no such thing as a
ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On that particular night the trouble began
as early as seven o’clock in the evening. They
had just come up from supper when Mrs. Péry
rushed into the hall, trembling with fright and
calling: ‘Mademoiselle!’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At about that
same time, probably hearing cries, Mr. Péry
came up the stairs from the kitchen where he
had been toasting cheese. He disliked to sleep
in the room in question, claiming that Madam
Jumel had come to the side of his bed in
white.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she described it quite a while. Mademoiselle
Nitschke said it was a very quiet September
night and hardly a leaf stirred.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
She said they all sat in absolute silence, and
things seemed to grow even more still as midnight
approached.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And when it came, a
loud rap, such as a wooden mallet might make,
came directly under Mr. Péry’s chair--“From
which,” she said, “he leaped as if he had been
shot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And I, for one, don’t blame
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, then Mademoiselle, who must
have been very brave, asked if Madam Jumel
desired prayers said for her, and Madam replied
with three knocks, which is knock-language
for yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Shelton told me more. And I enjoyed
it so much. But--I could not understand it,
and it made me feel creepy. I think it is
pleasanter not to believe in ghosts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this, since it was getting late, I went
downstairs and stood before the portrait. And
here I again asked for my bracelet. It seemed
to me the portrait smiled--unpleasantly, but I
suppose that was only my imagination. For
when you are nervous, you cannot tell what you
see, or what you don’t. And the real becomes
hazy and the unreal real. I was glad to go to
Mr. Kempwood’s. But I will tell about that
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the bracelet came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy slept with me, and we were ready to
sleep, having worked very hard to make flour
paste of the right consistency. It had to be
sloppy, and so that it wouldn’t harden when
cold. We also had to arrange an inner holder
for it, since the basket was not built to hold
juice. We didn’t get started undressing until
ten, and Jane, who is supposed to remind us of
bedtime, became very disagreeable. But we
ignored her and didn’t let her irritate us. We
fixed a heavy paper inside to the basket and
then poured the stuff in, and then Amy pulled
it halfway out on the line, so that Evelyn would
think he’d started something. We put ice in it,
and it began to feel far from pleasant. We both
tried it. “Sort of like cold frogs--mashed,”
said Amy, which was an admirable description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then after this we went to bed. We decided
we needn’t stay awake, for we felt sure that
Evelyn would yell. And she did, but that comes
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t go to sleep early. I have not since
the bracelet was first returned. And the consciousness
that it might come back again, in the
same way, made me lie awake and feel gaspy.
So--when I heard a little noise I was not surprised.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our door was open a little way,
and there was a noise at this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then a
scratching noise by my bedside (the bed head
is by the door).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the tiniest light something
glittered and made a bright point <span style='font-size:smaller'>SLOWLY
MOVING ACROSS THE FLOOR</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I struggled
up, and somehow found my searchlight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Swallowing hard and feeling sick, I pressed it.
The Jumel bracelet lay one yard inside the door
on the floor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was the glitter on the
gold that had let me see it, as it moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had come back again.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter X</span>--<span class='sc'>What Mr. Kempwood Told Me</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mr. Kempwood’s</span> “rooms,” as he called
them, were lovely. And I had a fine time going
around and looking at things. His furniture is
more than pretty; it has a reason. Everything
is either very comfortable, or very interesting.
And it all makes you want to linger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For instance, he opened a cabinette which
honestly held interesting things, not like Aunt
Penelope’s, which has only six fancy fans and
a lot of ancient scent-bottles and an autographed
book of poems and such truck. His has really
fascinating things in it, and it is, therefore,
worth the dusting trouble. There were all sorts
of books in it, written in different ways. I mean
scrolls--simply yards of those, and an East
Indian one written on reeds all strung together,
and even one on a brick. We agreed that it
would be frightful to have to scratch out a best
seller with a chisel. He said, “Think how your
wrist would feel by the time your hero gets his
best girl!” and I agreed. That brick was
Assyrian. Then he had little tiny gods that the
Egyptians buried with people. And he even had
the toilet things of an ancient queen, and it had
a tweezers in it, which led me to believe that
even then they pulled out the extra eyebrows
and made them skinny and beautiful, as women
do to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn has a woman come to do it each week,
if she can’t get down to Elizabeth Varden’s.
And she squawls--there are no other words for
this--while it is being done. But her eyebrows
are arched and beautifully shaped. I told Mr.
Kempwood how she yelled, as I suggested the
eyebrow theory. He laughed a good deal and
said maybe I was right. Then he said I really
oughtn’t to tell him things like that, and,
although I didn’t see why I shouldn’t, I said I
would not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he asked me to sit down, and I did (and
even I wanted to stay sitting, for his chairs are
wonderfully sittable), after which he rang and
we had tea, and since there were no plain bread
and butter sandwiches I felt no obligation to
eat any. I thanked Mr. Kempwood for omitting
them, and I ate a good deal and enjoyed myself
more than I have since reaching New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him a lot about Uncle Frank and Bradly-dear
and even about Willy Jepson. And he
asked me whether I thought I would marry
Willy, and I said not if anyone else asked me.
And then I had some more tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked me how old I was, at that point,
and when I said sixteen, he was surprised. I
don’t seem it. I know that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is one
reason Amy never has room in the motor for me.
I know I humiliate her by my lack of polish.
Baseball doesn’t develop much beside muscle
and quickness and a certain sort of flash judgment,
I have realized lately. But I shall acquire
those other things in the three years, of which
over a week has passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the bracelet to-day, Natalie?”
Mr. Kempwood asked, after looking at my
arms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wore a gray silk which has short
sleeves. It has broad white cuffs and a big
flaring white collar, and is pretty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I replied
that I thought I wouldn’t wear it, for I
knew no one would believe my story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re interested in the
Mansion?” he questioned further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I was, decidedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know its history?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a way,” I answered. “But not as well
as I shall.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. History has never interested
me. I didn’t think things that happened to dead
people vital, but lately----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “they may not be vital;
nothing but food and sleep really is, you know.
But the things that have happened are interesting,
because they make you <span class='it'>think</span>. Beside
making you realize what helped to form the great
country in which you live. Perhaps you haven’t
<span class='it'>seen</span> History. Perhaps you’ve just said, ‘In
1776 Washington occupied the Jumel Mansion
for some time’; or, ‘On Wednesday, July 3,
1833, Reverend Doctor Bogart married the
celebrated Col. Burr and Madam Jumel, widow
of the late Stephen Jumel,’ instead of <span class='it'>seeing</span>
Washington step out of that door and stand on
that porch.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Probably he watched the
burning of New York from there. (A great
many people think Nathan Hale started it.
New York was then in the hands of the British,
and many thought burning it was the thing to
do. There are a good many things about Nathan
Hale’s story that are still misty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) You
repeat dates about a wedding instead of <span class='it'>seeing</span>
a queer old woman, rouged and smirking, come
down the twisting stairs of the Jumel Mansion
to meet her groom, who was a tired old man,
poor and aware that a gay youth doesn’t leave
much precipitate for a comfortable old age.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He gained six thousand dollars by that marriage,
and she--some more experience with the law,
for she divorced him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood stopped and asked if he
might smoke. I said yes, and after he lit a
long cigarette, which he put in an interesting
holder, he went on with: “Can’t you <span class='it'>see</span> the
old lady and the old man being married? The
ceremony took place in the small parlour at the
left as one enters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Probably some servants
looked on. Perhaps the room was lit by candles,
dozens of them, flickering high, then low, and
casting shadows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My, what a house, what
memories she put in it.” Mr. Kempwood
paused, knocked off his ash, and then said: “Do
you know houses have souls? They have the
thoughts that their owners attach to their walls.
Haven’t you seen lovely houses and heard people
say: ‘Horrible place; I hate going there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They are all so sarcastic.’ You see--before one
knows it--the house absorbs the spirit of the
people who live in it, and one thinks of the <span class='it'>home</span>
as horrible. Now, Madam Jumel (you won’t
quite understand this, Natalie, and it’s difficult
to explain) didn’t have much chance, and she
wasn’t always good. In fact, she was far from
it. And she came to this house, which had belonged
to the Roger Morris family, who had
kept it fine and splendid, and she turned it to
a mad-house before she died, and left it in possession
of three quarrelling sets of heirs, who
dragged their claims through the courts for years
and years, and whose descendants are still bickering.
For those who had lost felt that they had
been cheated, and so they kept on bickering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think that a man who evades
fighting leaves a stain?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger Morris?” said Mr. Kempwood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but if the reasons for his not fighting
were sufficient, his evading it was right.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You see, his wife’s family, the Philipse, and the
Robinsons--I believe the Robinsons had a
country place still in existence at Dobbs Ferry,
that has staged some interesting history, too--they
all owned property,” he went on, “and if
Captain Morris had sided with the King, where
his sympathies probably lay, his property and
that of all his connection might have been burned
by the ‘Liberty Boys.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had a family
and a wife to care for. The Beverly Robinsons
and their clan were not used to poverty. He
could not drag them to it. We’ll say he left
for that reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did they burn houses?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they thought their owners sympathized
with England.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They <span class='it'>must</span> have had
a good time!” Mr. Kempwood stopped and
shook his head. “Imagine,” he said, “a mob
of a hundred men, all carrying sticks and throwing
stones and some of them swinging tin lanterns--from
which gleamed the feeble light of
candles. Probably they catcalled, sang, and
whistled as they tramped along the street, and
little girls in long quilted skirts ran after them,
and little boys--in homespun breeches--joined
the moving throng, adding their shrill voices,
whistles, sticks, and stones. Then perhaps they
would pause before a house and call, ‘Master
Benson, we’ll greet you immedjet’--and others,
‘Come forth, yuh dog!’ while the wag of the
crowd would sing a song of King George. Then
perhaps a window would slide up, and a man
who wore a nightcap would stick a head out and
ask for mercy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I doubt whether he
got it, for crowds are cruel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps his
wife and little girls would come out of the house,
carrying what little they could, and crying.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And then the man, sullen and angered, would be
put through a mock trial, for the benefit of the
jeering crowd.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And back of him a house
would blaze, and the things he had loved would
vanish in smoke.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A fire looks pretty
against a black night sky. The blazing red
which vanishes in sullen smoke.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
light.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they had to burn those houses, didn’t
they?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered; “George Washington
didn’t want them to. They did more harm than
good, for often they burned the houses of the
innocent, and a mob spirit--uncontrolled--has no
business in war. Anything is done better under
direction of a man who sees things coolly and
takes them quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I supposed this was so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened to the Jumel Mansion after
the Roger Morris family left it?” I asked.
“Did they come back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered. “The Philipse Manor
was confiscated and sold with the Morris
property, for these two families had gone back
to England.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was some mix-up
about the income from the properties--war
makes that, you know--and the heirs, I suppose,
were glad to dispose of the place, for John
Jacob Astor, seeing what is to-day called a
‘good buy,’ purchased the right of the heirs,
with legal power to transfer, for twenty thousand
pounds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Later, the State of New York
bought it from him for half a million dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the close of the Revolution until
Stephen Jumel bought the property, a period of
nearly thirty years, the old house was, in turn,
a humble farmhouse or an inn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Stages
began to go from Albany to New York in 1787,
and of course they stopped at the inn. Changed
horses, you know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Can’t you see them
dashing up in style, the whips cracking, the
horses sweating, then the stop, and the ladies,
all flounced and hooped of skirt, getting out to
walk about and shake the stiffness from their
bones? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps a gentleman would say,
‘Will madam do me the proud honour to sup
with me?’ and perhaps they had fried chicken
and mashed potato and pie--all on the table at
once. And I’m sure the innkeeper’s wife frankly
listened to their talk, for talk in those days took
the place of newspapers, which even our country
people get to-day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then after they’d
‘supped’ I think they’d go out and get in, the
ladies most ‘genteel’ settling their skirts, and
the gentlemen putting cushions back of them and
murmuring something about the ‘glories of all
blue skies paling beside the colour of their
orbs.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They did it that way, in those
days, Natalie,” Mr. Kempwood ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I knew it, but that I’d rather have a
man say right out if he liked me, that I preferred
sensible frankness. Mr. Kempwood said
he knew it and that he thought a man would try
to be awfully square with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I said, “What next?” and he smiled
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And--with a crack of a whip, they dashed
off to New York, a large town, which lay some
ten miles distant from the hamlet of Harlem
Heights!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did they go up to see the view, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood thought they did.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You
can see <span class='it'>miles</span> from the little balcony at the top
of the Jumel Mansion, and then, of course,
further, for nothing was built up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “probably the beau bowed
very low and said, ‘Will madam’--or mistress--‘honour
me by going up the stairs to see the
view from the top balcony, which is rumoured
to be the most beauteous, and is of great
renown?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then we stood up and I put on my things.
For we were going driving. We were through
with history for that day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But Mr. Kempwood
had made me see it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could actually
hear the creak of the old inn sign as it swung in
the wind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could see the tired horses, and
the little daughters of the innkeeper peeping
around the big white posts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For I am sure
that they were bashful country children (quite
like me) with no way to say what they felt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Probably they were afraid of the grand ladies
who travelled so “elegant” and who minced so
daintily as they walked. And perhaps, as they
sat around the fireplace at night, one would say:
“Mother, I was in the room turning the loom
and I heard the grand lady with the purple
ostrich plumes talk. She was a-viewing the view.
She said: ‘Laws, you bold man, I cannot
believe one word you say!’ He said: ‘No rose
in all of Heaven’s garden wears the bloom of
your sweet cheek!’ What do you think of that,
mother?” And then perhaps she would look
in the fire and dream.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For even little
country girls do that--if they can’t play
baseball!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a lovely, lovely drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood was so kind to me, and he
said he was going to take me every week. I
could hardly believe it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are <span class='it'>very</span> good to me,” I whispered.
For I felt it so deeply that it was hard
to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not,” he said. “I am being very good
to myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can’t tell you how much I
enjoy this, Natalie.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I slipped my hand in his and squeezed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little person,” he said, “you <span class='it'>are</span> a dear!”
And he smiled down at me, but he let go of my
hand after two pats. Then, before I knew it, it
was really late and time to get ready for dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate leaving you!” I said, as we stood in
our small outer hall. He thanked me and said
he felt that way about me. “But,” he said,
“we’ll have another ride soon, and I’ll see you
within a few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I couldn’t believe this; it seemed too
good. However, I saw him the next evening,
or, as they say in the North, afternoon. It was
at the Jumel Mansion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I was the
direct cause of it all, which makes me feel dreadfully.
But how could I tell that that would
happen and that I would make him get hurt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was terrible, but I am so thankful that it
was no worse. I think of that all the time--for,
if Mr. Kempwood <span class='it'>had</span> been killed, there is a
spot in my heart that would never have healed.
But--he wasn’t!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XI</span>--<span class='sc'>Strange Noises are Heard</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Saturday</span> night could not have been regarded
as restful. In fact, a great many things happened
beside the bracelet sliding in my room in
that strange way. I managed to get up enough
courage to get out of bed and put it away after
an hour or so. When I at last did get to sleep, it
was way past midnight, and I slept jerkily. Every
once and again I would find myself sitting up,
reaching for my flashlight and staring at that
spot near my bed where the Jumel bracelet had
lain. Then I would lie back, feeling sick,
trembling and breathing hard. I couldn’t seem
to help this. At twelve-thirty Evelyn let out a
terrible yell (there is no other word for this),
and things began to move. Even Amy and I
got up this time, feeling that we would not be
suspected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope, with her hair done in a tight
wad at the back of her head, was bending over
Evelyn and saying: “Well, can’t you <span class='it'>tell</span> me
what upset you?” And Evelyn kept gasping:
“No, no! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The hateful thing, he put--how
could he--oh, how could he!” Then she
stopped, surveyed her hand, and gasped some
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did ‘he put’?” Aunt Penelope questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Evelyn would only say, “Let me alone!”
between asserting that she was <span class='it'>sure</span> she was
going to have hysterics, and gasping. And she
told her mother that that flour paste on her hand
was Adonis Cream! And then she began to
moan. We had not realized that she would
blame him, and we began to feel worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, they got her feet in hot water, and
Aunt Penelope held the smelling-salts under her
nose, and even Uncle Archie joined the crowd.
And I think it is the only time that I ever saw
aunt with him when she didn’t ask him for
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” he asked, looking at Evelyn,
who had closed her eyes and was leaning back
against the chair in a limp, sick way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can tell me,” said Aunt Penelope
irritably, “<span class='it'>I</span> will be grateful! I am <span class='it'>aroused</span>
from my sleep by hearing Evelyn scream, and I
get here and she won’t explain, and----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother,” gasped Evelyn, “if you keep this
up I will have <span class='it'>hysterics</span>; I am in <span class='it'>no</span> mood to--bear
it--<span class='it'>oh</span>, the <span class='it'>feeling</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Huh!</span>” grunted Uncle Archie, and paddled
off to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then aunt told us to stay with Evelyn while
she hunted the aromatic spirits of ammonia, and
we settled down to listen to her gasp. We felt
sorry, but it was sort of funny, and especially
when she said: “Is nothing <span class='it'>true</span>, is nothing
<span class='it'>sacred</span>?” And I suppose she meant that that
basket should have been too hallowed to him to
fill with flour paste. Amy giggled, and then said
she felt nervous and that made it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Evelyn didn’t hear her, so it didn’t matter.
She was too busy being dramatic. “To think,”
she whispered, “that I believed him--thought it
<span class='it'>real</span>!” And then, as they say in fiction, “she
laughed hollowly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this she calmed, and while we were
waiting for Aunt Penelope’s return the noise came,
a scratching noise on the window-sill in my room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>What’s that?</span>” Evelyn gasped, sitting up
and quite forgetting to be limp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” I answered, but my heart
began to pump, for I was afraid I did. I felt
that it was connected with my bracelet, and I
later found that I was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood up and tried to go to my room, but
my knees didn’t work well. They seemed to
think that they were castanets and that I wanted
them to play a tune. I didn’t--but that didn’t
influence them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hush!</span>” said Evelyn, and she leaned forward,
and in the stillness we listened.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There would be a scraping sound, then a lull,
and then another long, grating, rasping sound.
And on top of this suddenly there were two
raps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Somehow I reached the door which
led to the small hall that connected the rooms,
and from here I almost shouted: “<span class='it'>What do you
want?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then--after one rap and the splintering
sound of wood--the noises stopped. I sank
down in a chair by the door and bit my lips to
steady them. When I looked at Amy she was
biting too, but at her nails, and as if they must
<span class='it'>all</span> be shortened just as far as possible in ten
seconds. She looked terribly intent and funny.
I saw that even then. Evelyn had got one foot
out of the tub, and held it, dripping in mid-air.
She had her left hand over her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Aunt Penelope came back, looking as
white as a sheet and carrying the bottle of
ammonia upside down in one hand (uncorked
too) and the ice-pick in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you <span class='it'>hear</span> it?” she whispered. And
then she went over to Evelyn and said: “Drink
this immediately! <span class='it'>Immediately!</span>” and gave her
the ice-pick. But no one laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was an awful noise, and everyone
screamed, but the voice of Uncle Archie was
heard to say something that I cannot quote, and
everyone was reassured. He had only run into
an onyx pedestal which has Leonardo da Vinci’s
or Raphael’s (I’ve forgotten which) flying
Mercury on it. He had encountered this in the
dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment he stood in the doorway, rubbing
his shins and muttering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will tell me!” rattled Aunt Penelope,
so fast you could hardly hear her words, “I
shall be grateful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We must all be calm!
(Amy, stop biting your nails! You drive me
crazy!) I was in the pantry when <span class='it'>it</span> began--in
Natalie’s room, I think.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Evelyn, put your
foot back in the tub; the water is dripping <span class='it'>all</span>
over the rug.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I heard it--and----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hugh!” grunted Uncle Archie, and went
toward my room. In it, we heard him turn on
the lights and put up the window which opened
on the small iron balcony, from which one can
lower a fire-escape if necessary. Trembling, we
followed him. Evelyn didn’t even stop to wipe
her feet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And we saw that the window-sill
was splintered and that there were deep dents
in it, as if someone had pounded in a huge nail
and then pulled it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More thieving,” said aunt. “We must be
calm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am going to faint, I know I am.
Evelyn, get your bedroom slippers. There
seems to be no safety, no calm. But if you will
just try to hold on to <span class='it'>control</span>----” And then
somehow Amy got tangled up in the telephone
cord and pulled the telephone from the table,
and the table over with it, and aunt simply
screamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Archie was tired. He said he was
going to live at the club if things didn’t change,
and the frank way he talked diverted everyone
for a few moments. Then, after a half-hour
more everyone went to bed, but the lights were
all left on and no one slept much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Before
I went to bed, I looked for the bracelet, which
I was surprised to find undisturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a very late breakfast the next morning,
and we all had it together and really had a
good time. Even Evelyn was pleasant, and it
was the last time for ages that she was nice to
me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We had the Sunday papers to look
at (Uncle Archie gets a great many), and we all
had a section and commented on the pictures,
and that made talk.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Evelyn became
greatly interested in a group of pictures of some
important Spanish people who had been visiting
New York on some mission. Someone had taken
them to see the Jumel Mansion, because of course
it is a great show place; and outside of this a
reporter had snapped them. I felt sure that
Señorita Marguerita Angela Blanco y Chiappi
was the little Spanish woman who had so greatly
admired the Jumel bracelet and who had so extravagantly
voiced her admiration in her liquid
tongue. By her was a tall, very handsome man,
who looked down, and he was a Cuban sugar
king, it said under the picture. His name was
Vicente Alcon y Rodriguez. Evelyn and I decided
he admired Marguerita a great deal. His look
at her made the picture very interesting. Then
of course there were two or three others, standing
on the steps, and one walking toward the
camera with one foot in mid-air, and a swinging
arm blurred. That has to happen in every group
photograph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We fooled around this way until about a
quarter of twelve, and then, because the day was
lovely, Amy and I decided to take a walk, and
Evelyn, who hadn’t an engagement before three,
said she’d go with us. So we all put on our
outdoor things and started out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Evelyn
was just as pleasant as she could be, and we
had a lovely time! And I can’t think why she
isn’t that way always, since everyone likes her
so much when she is kind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But once in a
while she was quiet and seemed absent-minded,
and during one of these attacks Amy whispered:
“We’ll have to fix it. She thinks it was <span style='font-size:smaller'>HIM</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded. And I agreed. We really didn’t
want to hurt her or to make trouble. We only
wanted to have a little fun. She does raise such
Cain that it is hard not to frighten her if one has
a good opportunity. And of course, if you have
initiative, you cannot help making your opportunities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day, as I said, was lovely and made
being out great fun. There was a high wind
which swept your skirts around you, made you
draw deep breaths, and fight to walk against it.
Evelyn didn’t like it so much, but Amy and I did,
thoroughly. Then a great many men chased
hats (and most of them were fat and bald), which
added to the interest of the stroll, and we saw
men taking photographs of people on the street.
They go around doing this on Sundays and
holidays, especially. Some of the people looked
funny while they were being taken, and we enjoyed
that, although of course we didn’t let them
see that we did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a long half-hour of this Evelyn said she
was tired, and we turned toward home. At the
corner we encountered Mr. Herbert Apthorpe,
who is part owner of the basket. He fell into
step with us. Evelyn icily presented him to me;
he greeted me casually and then spoke to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you aren’t tired after last night?”
he said. Evelyn had gone to a party with him,
and he referred to that, but she understood it in
a different way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am tired,” she replied. “It
was the most horrible experience of my life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked baffled, as anyone would, and not
exactly flattered. Although Amy and I were
sorry, we couldn’t help giggling, for it was so
funny to see them. Evelyn glared at him, and
he did nothing but swallow. He had been
grinning at her in a silly way for a few moments
after they met, sort of as if he didn’t want to,
but couldn’t help it, and that made me agree with
Amy about their mutual interest. But soon his
grin faded; I think he swallowed it. I never saw
anyone do so much swallowing. His Adam’s
apple looked like a monkey on a stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never pretended that I could dance,” he
said stiffly. Evelyn ignored this. Then he
looked at us, and I felt in his look a great lack
of cordiality. I am sure he wished that we
weren’t there. But we were glad we were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot see----” he said. “I do not
understand----” And then Evelyn actually
allowed herself a sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You alone,” she said, “understand my
horror of slimy things. You alone know about
the receptacle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (I suppose she thought
“receptacle” would stall us, but it didn’t) “and
so,” she finished coldly, “the rôle of innocent
is absurd to assume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Evelyn!</span>” he said, and the way he said it
was really dramatic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, her voice shaking, she ended with:
“I am at loss to comprehend your ideas of
<span class='it'>humour</span>, Mr. Apthorpe, and I must request that
you do not ask me to comprehend any of your
moods hereafter!” And then, with head held
high, she swept into the door, and we followed
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were really proud to know her, for she
had done it so beautifully. But we were sorry
too, and decided to fix it up when we had time.
However, the violets made it worse. I warned
Amy against taking them, but she would, since
they had an orchid in them, and she wanted to
dazzle a girl she doesn’t like but was going to
take driving. However, that happened Monday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At two on Sunday Mr. Kempwood sent me
up a little ivory elephant that I had liked, to
<span class='it'>keep</span>, and a magazine which he loaned me
because it had some letters in it from Captain
Roger Morris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Amherst Morris had written the article,
and it appeared in the <span class='it'>Hertfordshire Magazine</span>
for November, 1907.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one letter he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“God Almighty grant that some fortunate
circumstance will happen to bring about a suspension
of hostilities. As for myself, I breathe
only: Peace I can have none until I am back
with you. How much I miss you! Your repeated
marks of tender love and esteem so daily
occur to my mind that I am totally unhinged.
Only imagine that I, who, as you well know,
never thought myself so happy anywhere as
under my own roof, have now no home, and am
a wanderer from day to day.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And that did make me feel sorry for him! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I think his wife, who Mr. Kempwood says was
a famed beauty and a toast of that day (for men
drank toasts to women then, if they liked them),
must have been kind as well as pretty. For a
man may love a woman first for the loveliness of
her skin or her eyes or her hair, but he loves
her long for only one thing, and that is the beauty
of her spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another letter he called her his “Dearest
Life,” which I think must have gratified her,
and in this he wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“My chief wish is to spend the remainder of
my days with you, whose Prudency is my great
comfort, and whose Kindness in sharing with
patience and resignation those misfortunes which
we have not brought upon ourselves, is never
failing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I was interested in those letters. I think the
way they expressed themselves in other days is
fascinating. And shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, the changes that have come
to men and women.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Vernon Castle’s
letters to his wife were not at all like that (Evelyn
cut some of those out of a magazine), and I am
quite sure if a man was in Captain Roger Morris’
circumstances to-day he would write: “Dear
old Girl, I do hope things will clear up in a
hurry, for I would like to get home, you can
bet;” or something like that. You cannot
imagine the average New Yorker of to-day calling
his wife “Dearest Life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I read the magazine, I decided I would
go out again, for I have never got over the stuffy
feeling that indoors gives me. I feel as if I am
only half breathing. So I put on my things and
started out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a queer way the Jumel Mansion beckoned
to me. I felt as if I must go there. I suppose
it is my nervous dread of what may happen next
to my bracelet that almost <span class='it'>makes</span> me visit it,
but anyway, whatever it is, when I walk I find
myself turning toward it and, before I know it,
<span class='it'>there</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when I first reached it I was so glad I
had decided to go, for I found Mr. Kempwood
coming up the long walk from Amsterdam
Avenue, and he waved to me, and I waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked him as hard as I could for the
elephant. He told me that he had put a little
charm on that elephant and that I was to keep
it as long as I liked him; and when I stopped,
I must return it, for in such case his wish--or
charm--would have to break. I said it was mine
for life, for I was sure I would always care for
him and his friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very soberly he said: “Please do.” And
then, after a long breath (the wind was high
again, and I suppose he felt it), he asked me
where I was going. I told him to the Jumel
Mansion, Washington’s headquarters, and the
Roger Morris House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said I was a clever person to do it all at
once, which was a joke, as they are all one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
“Suppose,” he said, “we sit down outside, or
is it too cold for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied that it wasn’t, and we climbed the
high steps and settled on a green bench which
faces the Jumel Mansion porch.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And Mr.
Kempwood talked and made me see things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look over there,” he said. I looked. I
saw nothing until he spoke again and made me
pretend, and suddenly I <span class='it'>seemed</span> to see. “There
is an elegant carriage,” he said, “for ‘elegant’
is what they said in those days, but the horses’
heads droop, for they have come all the way
from New York to enable the Charming Polly
to see the spot where she will live.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She
has got out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘Roger,’ she says, ‘I think
it is a grand site, and most beautiful we shall
be situated!’ And he mutters, ‘Dearest heart
of hearts,’ but under his breath, for Mrs. Robinson
is with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The river’s so calm flowing!’ Mary
Philipse Morris, or the Charming Polly, continues.
‘But is it prudence for us to have two
establishments, my husband?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Anything you wish, and that I can give
you, is prudence,’ he responds gallantly. And
Mrs. Beverly Robinson, who has overheard a
bit of this, puts in with: ‘The air, my dear, for
you and the children is worth a deal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Often I have remarked to Beverly, since our
living part time at Dobbs Ferry: “How did we
stand the entire year within the strict confines
of the crowded town?” ’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I smiled at Mr. Kempwood and said I liked
that, for I had, a lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she have on?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um----” he muttered, and frowned.
“Stumped!” he confessed, and laughed. “I
suppose she wore a cap?” he continued, “for
they did at about twenty-seven in those days.
And a sky-blue satin frock, all quilted and made
very tight around the waist. Fitted, you know;
low-necked and with a lace ruffle which fell over
her shoulders? Would that do, Nat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I liked his calling me Nat. I told him so. It
made me think of uncle, and I told him that too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “I like your liking it, but
I don’t like my reminding you of your uncle!”
And then he poked around in the gravel at his
feet with his cane. He seemed to be thinking
pretty hard, and I didn’t interrupt him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while he asked if I thought thirty-three
very old, and I said I didn’t. Although
I really did. But I judged he was thirty-three,
and he is. However, I have come to know that
age is misleading, for he is quite as young as I
am inside. The years have only added niceness
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After another silence, I asked him to go on,
and he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a group on the porch,” he said,
“and in front of this stands a man called
Washington. He is staring off toward New
York, which is a huge city of some thirty
thousand souls. There is a tired sag to his
shoulders, and discouragement shows in every
line of his figure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He rubs his hand across
his eyes--see? Probably he hasn’t slept well,
for worries will make even a good bed hard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He has been made Commander-in-Chief of the
Army recently. It seems John Adams urged
this at the second Continental Congress in Philadelphia,
in 1775.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way things are going makes him unhappy--nervous.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. True, he had driven
the British from Boston, which they had held
about two years, and they were also whipped out
of North and South Carolina. But now they
are turning their attention to New York, the
Hudson River, and Lake Champlain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Washington has guessed that they hope to divide
the North and the South, and so he has mustered
troops and hurried them here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It has been
a military headquarters before, and so he does
not have to ask permission for its use from Mrs.
Roger Morris. That might embarrass him, for
it was said that he once entertained rather tender
sentiments toward that lady.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wonder if
he’s thinking of her now? Do you think so,
Nat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood stared toward the porch, and
I did too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he is,” I said, “I hope his wife won’t
know it, for she is probably worrying about him,
and it would be discouraging to worry about a
man who is romancing over a lost love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood agreed. “Forgotten Martha!”
he said. “All apologies! He is thinking of
her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See him take a wallet out of his
pocket and pretend to look at a map? Well,
under that there’s a silhouette. He’s looking
at that----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded, for I liked that better. “I’m sure
he loved her,” I said. “Probably he looks back
at his younger affair and says: ‘In truth, I was
a young idiot, to think my heart did pound a
merry tune for her, who now wears two chins
where but one should be!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood liked that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What made him discouraged?” I asked;
“anything in particular?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Mr. Kempwood, “the day
before some of his troops from Connecticut
turned and fled in utter terror. The British had
landed in New York, and our boys, hearing this,
had let their imaginations get the best of
them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There were only sixty of the foe,
but nothing could induce our poor soldiers to
stand up to them. Horse-whippings (and they
were whipped by everyone, from Washington
down) had no effect; they simply turned and
fled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know,” he said, with a meaning
look at me, “imagination can make lots that
isn’t worth notice grow very gruesome!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I smiled and nodded. Then I looked down at
my bracelet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The battle of Harlem Heights came somewhere
along there,” he went on; “I don’t know
quite when. But our soldiers fought well, after
that one day of fright, and redeemed themselves.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The British, after that, for a little
space, took the affair as a joke. And when they
started out to fight one day, blew bugles to indicate
that it was in the nature of a hunt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But they didn’t do that more than once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was General Washington here very long?”
I asked, as I looked up at the porch and seemed
to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Mr. Kempwood answered, “only
thirty-three days. After that the British took
possession.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When you think of what those
old walls have seen and heard----” Mr. Kempwood
paused. Then he stood up, smiled down
at me, and I knew that history was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child,” he said, “that breeze is
too strong. I am sure that your tam will have
rheumatism. I should feel so sorry if it grew
stiff. I like to see it waving in the wind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Shall we go in for a little while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought it would be fine, and we
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we stood before the portrait of Madam
Jumel and her niece and nephew, I began to feel
cold and frightened. Mr. Kempwood pointed
out the break in the canvas, and I couldn’t help
feeling a little scornful toward the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weak,” I said. Mr. Kempwood, like most
people, misunderstood my meaning. He thought
I meant because he had let himself be married at
fifteen--to a woman who only wanted his money.
He was paid for that, poor boy, in more than
unhappiness, for Madam Jumel disinherited him.
And she sewed a black patch over his face too,
saying that he had placed it there by hurting his
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, as I looked, she seemed to smile. I
became frightfully, absurdly, frightened, and I
slipped the bracelet from my arm. “She does
not want me to have it!” I whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood laughed at me, and even
ridiculed me a little, but it did not help. Then
he took the bracelet and slipped it in his pocket.
I let him have it until I was myself again, and
then I took it back. We were alone in a little
back room at that time, looking up at a high-set
cupboard, which Mr. Kempwood thought
had once held much good English ale. And he
said he wished some of it would come back to
haunt its home of long before, since he was
getting tired of Bevo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ashamed,” I said; “give me the
bracelet!” And he clasped it on, and said:
“Now, dear child, no more nonsense!” But he
was so gentle about this that it was not a scolding.
After that he said, “By George!” and
looked at his watch. “Dinner engagement,”
he added quickly, “and a half-hour over-due.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good-bye, Nat. I’ll see you Monday
or Tuesday--want to take you to the Hippodrome----”
But he saw me before that, and
he did not keep the dinner engagement.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He couldn’t, for he was unconscious--at that
time, I thought dead!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XII</span>--<span class='sc'>What Happened</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>For</span> a few minutes after Mr. Kempwood left, I
moved around looking at the Napoleon relics,
which, of course, are fascinating. Some people
think that Stephen Jumel bought these from
Royalty itself, but others think that they came
to Madam Jumel and were by way of wiping out
an indebtedness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Madam Jumel lived in
Paris between 1819 and 1826, and during those
years the cousin of the Empress Josephine, who
was Madame la Comtesse de la Pagerie, made
her home with the Jumels, and moved with them
from house to house as they did--seeming one
of the family--part of the establishment. I
think she was not well off and had to accept much
from the Jumels for which she could make no
return. So, when Madam Jumel came back to
America the Comtesse settled in snuff-boxes,
vases, shoe-buckles, lockets, and dear knows
what all. And I think Madam Jumel probably
made a good bargain, for she was the sort who
could do that. It is said that the things that
she brought to the United States were valued at
twenty-five thousand dollars, which strengthens
the fact that she must have got them without
money output, for at that time Stephen Jumel
was in pecuniary straits and probably a sum of
that size would have been difficult for him to
spare for such purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I loved looking at them and thinking of how
the Empress Josephine might have had this or
that small box upon her dressing-table. And it
always gives me a curious feeling. I think old
things are much more interesting because of the
people who have touched them, and I have often
thought that if you could touch one of these
things and close your eyes you might drift off into
a dream that would take you into another time,
but I suppose that is silly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I had moved around for perhaps seven
or eight minutes I heard a small boy call to
another. “Come out here!” he screamed in a
high soprano. “There’s a man biffed on the
bean, and <span class='it'>mebbe</span> he’s dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And how people moved! I didn’t immediately.
I couldn’t, for I remembered my giving
Mr. Kempwood the bracelet, and I <span class='it'>knew</span> what
had happened. I felt sick, and swallowed hard,
although I hadn’t any more spit than usual. But
that is the way that fright made me feel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It was the worst I had ever felt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Somehow
I hurried toward the door with the crowd,
and I then did the second cowardly thing which
hurt one of my friends who cares for the
Mansion, I slipped off my bracelet and handed
it to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until I come back----” I whispered, after
a gasp. He nodded and put it in his pocket. I
suppose he thought I was afraid of sneak thieves
in the mob which had collected. Then I pushed
through the door.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All the excitement was
back of the Mansion where--Mr. Kempwood
lay on the ground--absolutely white and with his
eyes closed, and people were bending over him.
I began to sob, although I didn’t cry any tears
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me through,” I said, as I tried to get
past the circle which had formed. “I know
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He has been
good to me, and he is my friend!” And then,
somehow I had reached him and was on my
knees beside him, holding one of his cold, stiff
hands between both of mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he dead?” I whispered to one of the
policemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stunned,” he answered. For a moment I
held his hand tightly pressed against my heart,
and then I began to sob harder than ever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I think the relief that comes with good news
often makes you more upset than the bad and
hurts more. I don’t know why this is, but it is
so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After a few moments a policeman
asked me where he lived, and I told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone offered a motor, and they began to
lift Mr. Kempwood. Another officer had detained
some people and was questioning them.
“Weren’t you here?” he asked of a heavy old
Italian woman who had been sitting on a bench,
but she only shook her head, blinked and
muttered: “Non parlo la Inglesa, parlo Italiano
solamente!” And someone said she had been
sleeping, but the officer looked doubtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless,” he said, “we will take you
along,” and I, in that moment, saw that she did
understand, for in her eyes was a sudden glint
of terror. It faded soon, and she replaced it
with a vacant look, but--I had caught the other.
I think she had <span class='it'>seen</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows,” I began to say, when suddenly
everything was forgotten, for, from the Jumel
Mansion came a cry which began loudly and
faded to a horrible silence, and the cry was for
help.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course, the officers ran, and
somehow--the old Italian woman slipped away.
I had seen her the moment before, but when I
turned back to look after Mr. Kempwood, I
found only the old blind man coming up the side
steps to the garden, shuffling, shambling up, with
his cane feeling the way. He and I and a doctor
were alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old Italian woman has gone,” I said,
“and I think she knew----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think so,” said the doctor as he
moved Mr. Kempwood’s head and felt the back
of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Couldn’t speak English; she was
frightened. When the men come back we can
get someone to help us lift him in a motor. He’s
going to come around all right, but that was a
blow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Right over the back of the head.
You say he lives near here?” I nodded, and
then someone came back and helped us lift Mr.
Kempwood in a motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened in there?” I asked unsteadily,
as we moved toward the gate and down
the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the guards knocked senseless,” he
answered. “Over the back of the head--like
this. Busy day for excitement around here--there
you are. He <span class='it'>is</span> a weight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
guard isn’t hurt badly and nothing broken, but
the glass over the little case that held the bracelet
is cracked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded, feeling more sick and faint than
ever, and then we turned toward home. The
doctor held up Mr. Kempwood, who was beginning
to groan, and I held his cane and said my
prayers hard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For I felt that it was all
my fault. And that is a terrible feeling.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow, I got through the next hour. I will
never know how.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They settled Mr. Kempwood,
told me he wasn’t going to die and would
truly be all right, and I left. Of course, I went
back to the Jumel Mansion. I had to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here I found the sort of let down that you
always find after excitement. Everyone was
limp and sat down whenever possible. One of
the women told me about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in the back room,” she said. “Mr.
Kelsey had just come in and shown me your
bracelet. He whispered to me: ‘Think I’ll put
it up in the cupboard, then if she comes back for
it when I’m not here, you can give it to her----’
I nodded, thinking that a safe place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That
high cupboard, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did. It had always fascinated me. It
seemed big enough for a spy to hide in, and I
wondered whether one ever had hidden
there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He put it there,” she went on, “and then
went back to the front room. I went to the
window and looked out at the crowd which had
collected about your friend Mr. Kempwood, and
then I heard Mr. Kelsey’s cry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose
I was slow about reaching him; you know how
your knees act and how fright sometimes slows
actions, for before I reached him I heard the
blow which I found afterward had been directed
at the bracelet case, and when I reached him
he was not alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The old blind man who
is around here so much was with him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He
was standing in the doorway, saying, ‘Someone
is hurt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Someone is hurt. Will no one
come to help?’ and there were tears on his
cheeks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It, added to all the rest, was
almost the last straw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him in the garden before I left,” I
said, “and he was all right then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t have,” she contradicted; “he
was here the entire time. Someone took him off
and started him toward Amsterdam Avenue, and
that was ten minutes after the whole affair had
quieted down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I said, and with some heat, “I <span class='it'>did</span>
see him. I <span class='it'>really</span> did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you,” she asked, “if he was
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head and gave it up. She was
unconvinced, I could see. Probably thinking
that the excitement had made me incapable of
realizing what I had really seen or when I had
seen it. But I had seen him in the garden. I
knew that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “that isn’t vital. You said
Mr. Kelsey isn’t badly hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she assured me that he wasn’t, and I
was greatly relieved. Then she gave me the
bracelet. I snapped it on, and left. As I went
out, I paused before the portrait, for it did seem
as if what Madam Jumel saw from that had an
effect on events; made them--rather--horrible
ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I couldn’t speak, for there were people in the
hall, but I bared my arm and thought very hard:
“I have it back. If anyone must be hurt I
must be the person, for it is mine, and hereafter
I will keep the responsibility.” And after
that--I turned toward home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stopped at Mr. Kempwood’s going up, and
I found that he was conscious and wanted to see
me. I was very glad to see him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
couldn’t speak at all, but simply clung to his
hand. However, he seemed to understand, so
it was all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Miss Natalie Randolph Page,”
he ordered, and a servant slid a chair near his
bed, and I did. Then the man left, and we were
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know it was my fault,” I said, “because
I gave you that bracelet.” And then I had to
stop speaking. That made me dreadfully
ashamed. I had to look down, too, because I
didn’t want him to see that my eyes were full of
tears.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Once I never cried! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
the whole affair was making me jumpy and unlike
my old self. And Mr. Kempwood’s being hurt
had almost made me sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Nat,” he said, turning over very
carefully so that he faced me, “we’re friends,
aren’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded, just as hard as I could, for emphasis.
For various reasons, I decided I would not speak
just then. I was afraid my voice would behave
as Willy Jepson’s used to when he was fourteen.
He himself never knew whether it was going to
sound like Hamlet, in the soliloquy, or Miss
Hooker when she saw a fuzzy caterpillar; and
those ranges differ widely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if we’re friends,” went on Mr. Kempwood,
“whatever bothers you must bother me.
I want it to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head. “Oh <span class='it'>no</span>!” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, then stopped (I think it hurt), and
said, “Oh <span class='it'>yes</span>!” just the way I said “Oh no!”
I laughed a little, and then I wiped my eyes.
“When I thought you were dead----!” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” he ordered. “What happened?
Did you mind it, or wonder whether you had
enough of your allowance left for a nice wreath?
Honestly, confess your thought!” All over
again, I choked up. “My dear,” he said suddenly
(I think he saw how I felt), “I’m not
going to leave life. I love it too much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Especially since we’ve been friends. Why, I’d
hang on to it now, with both hands, and I’d
like to see anyone make me let it go! Nat, I’m
going to stick around, and by the time you’re
twenty we’ll be the best friends going.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I’ve planned my campaign; you’re helpless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I smiled at him and explained how much he
had helped me in New York, and how different
he had made it all seem. Of course, I told him
that my aunt, uncle, and cousins were kind to
me (for they <span class='it'>are</span>), but I said once in a while I was
a little lonely, and when I thought of New York
without him I almost fainted. And I explained
about how I had felt when I thought he was
dead. Especially about the swallowing so much
when there was nothing to swallow and no occasion
for doing it. And I added that lots of times
in the dentist’s chair when I needed to swallow,
<span class='it'>dreadfully</span>, I couldn’t, and that it was strange
how emotions affected you. He listened attentively
and agreed with me about the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he asked if I had been carrying his cane
around all day, and I looked and found I had!
I was surprised! I must have taken it to the
Jumel Mansion, back, and even up to aunt’s. I
clung to it without thinking, because I was so
upset, I suppose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t need it,” he said, with a flicker
of hurt going across his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered. And I did wish I were
tactful, but I never know quite what to say
beside the truth, which makes me clumsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you care an awful lot about men who
go in for athletics, don’t you?” he asked.
“They seem <span class='it'>men</span> to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think he imagined that our friendship couldn’t
be as deep because I liked outdoor things and his
lameness kept him from enjoying them. But--it
was deeper; for while I knew all he missed, I
also saw all he gained--from pain, or whatever
it is, that makes some people, who aren’t strong
in all ways, nicer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like you best this way,” I said, and very
awkwardly, I’m afraid, but Mr. Kempwood
always seems to understand. “I’m sorry you
have to carry it,” I went on, “but I think it has
made you nicer and kinder. If I were ever very
unhappy, or needed help, I would come to you.”
And then I stood up, for I thought it was time
to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can leave my cane by the bedside,” he
said. “I find I don’t dislike it--quite so much
as I thought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Then his voice changed
and became everyday, and he said: “Good-bye,
child. You’re not going to be nervous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I promised him I wouldn’t and waved at him
from the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went up to our floor feeling much better.
Everyone was out, and I decided to dress because
Evelyn was to have guests, and she had said
that Amy and I might appear for a little while,
if we liked. On my bureau I found a note. It
was scrawled hurriedly as before and had the
same initials under it, and it said: “Don’t wear
the duplicate of my bracelet to-day. I will see
that something unpleasant happens if you do!--E.
J.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XIII</span>--<span class='sc'>Blue Monday</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Everything</span> started wrong Monday morning
when Amy found that Evelyn was going to return
some violets Mr. Apthorpe sent her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s disgusting,” she said, “for they have
an orchid in them.” And then she stood looking
out of the window and tapping on the glass with
her finger-tips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to rain all day,” she said next. “I
know it will; slow rains like this always do. And
I haven’t a decent thing for fall wear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Look how the leaves are blowing--must have
come for blocks. It’s a horrid time!” And
then she sat down and stared dismally ahead of
her. I felt like that too, for the day was depressing,
and the happenings of the afternoon before
had left me feeling fearful of what might come
next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had all been reasoned out that a pair of
thieves had worked together, and that one, finding
Mr. Kempwood alone, had thought what his
pockets might hold worth the risk of holding him
up. And--the empty Jumel Mansion had
afforded another opportunity. It was all reasoned
out, as I said, and sounded well, but--I didn’t
believe it. I knew it was connected with my
bracelet. There were too many signs that
pointed to this. I was absolutely sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never had any orchids,” said Amy after
a few moments, “and mother didn’t let me have
any summer furs. And sometimes I don’t know
what life <span class='it'>has</span> held for me--<span class='it'>except pain</span> and <span class='it'>going
without</span>.” Then she fumbled for a handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consider,” she said oratorically, after she
had wiped her eyes, “how I could <span class='it'>use</span> that
orchid. Here, I am taking Gladys Howell to
Bertha Clay’s little party this afternoon (Bertha
asked me to stop for her), and I could so easily
use it to impress them. I have never liked them
because they have constantly impressed upon
me that they were older. I think an orchid
mashed in a lot of violets would make them sit
up and respect me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I agreed with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think Evelyn would give them to
you?” I asked. “Maybe she could tell him she
wouldn’t accept them, but that you would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s <span class='it'>like</span> you,” said Amy, and almost
sneered, so I realized that my suggestion wasn’t
a good one. We were quiet after that, for I
didn’t know what to say, and Amy didn’t want
to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The direction of the rain had changed, and it
began to fall more quickly, beating a little,
sombre tune upon the window as it fell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The ivy on the house next door was dripping,
and the leaves hung their heads. And here and
there were thin spots where the arms of the vines
stood out boldly against the bricks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fall
had come, I could see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Down below, the
pavements would be sticky with rain and dust
together making a paste; and here and there a
leaf would glue itself tight to the walk, its colours
spoiled by the city dirt it had caught after it fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew what would be happening at
home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Every little lane would have a bonfire
after dark, and the sparks from those would
fly against the first, gray night sky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then
the girls and boys would come out and all play
hide-and-seek all over the town and even down
by the river in the lumber.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the air
would be cool and make you want to run. And
the leaves would rustle in every gutter, for there
are so many trees that, even with sweeping up
and burning the leaves constantly, there are
always more--more and more.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the
crowd would roast apples and corn, and the creek
is lovely in the late afternoons, echoing as it does
all the red and golden world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We always
had paper chases in the fall, too, and that was
great fun because the paper would get lost in
the leaves and the trail was easily lost.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Sitting there, in that hot, stuffy apartment, I
saw it all, and I seemed to smell the burning
leaves and the odour of baking apples, and hear
the snap of chestnuts as they opened in the heat.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And oh, how I wanted it! I wanted to
go home and play ball in the middle of the street;
to see Miss Hooker mincing along and hear her
call: “Natalie, aren’t you <span class='it'>ashamed</span> to play ball--a
great girl like you!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To go home way
after supper-time, so hungry that I ached under
my belt, and to find that Bradly-dear had made
fresh doughnuts, and that Uncle Frank had all
three pairs of glasses on his forehead--and was
hunting them all so that he could look more
closely at a cocoon he had just found.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
I wanted it! I think I would have been utterly
miserable, but Amy diverted me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to take them,” she said, standing up.
“Evelyn will never know, and he won’t go rooting
around in a returned box. If he has any
sense of fitness, he will fling it from him with a
curse and bury his head in his arms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew Amy had read that somewhere, because
it wasn’t her style, but I didn’t say I knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t he?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I supposed he would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, what’s the use of those violets
and that orchid <span class='it'>rotting</span>?” she asked; and she
acted exactly as if I were opposing her, although
I was not. Often, I have found, people do this
when they want to convince themselves. They
shout at you, as if you, instead of their conscience,
were objecting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said there wasn’t any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>hate</span> waste,” she stated loudly and stood
up. “And hasn’t the Government preached
against waste for ages? Orchids are much more
valuable than flour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew that, and said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she confided that the box was in the
hall, waiting for Ito to take it down, and that
Evelyn had put a note inside. Amy said she
was going to take the note out, slip it under the
cord, and weight the box with something light
so that its emptiness wouldn’t be suspicious.
Then she left, to return in a moment, looking
very satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put an old pair of stockings in it,” she said.
“Evelyn had thrown them in the waste basket
because they had a run up the back, and it feels
just right when you lift it. Ito took the flowers
and put them in the pantry refrigerator and said
he wouldn’t speak of them after I gave him fifty
cents. I hated that, but when you consider--an
orchid and violets are cheap at fifty cents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that she was quite cheered up, and I
became so too. We decided we must right the
wrong we had done, and fix up Evelyn’s and
Mr. Apthorpe’s quarrel. And it seemed quite
safe to blame it on Jane, but it wasn’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We took a piece of paper out of the waste basket,
and Amy wrote: “I did it. I put the paste in
the basket as a joke. I beg forgiveness.--Jane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that wasn’t like Jane. And we compromised
on “I done it. I put that there paste
in the basket and kindly ask your pardon.--Jane.”
And we giggled quite a little over doing
it. Then we took it to Evelyn’s room and put
it back of the hair receiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose she speaks to Jane?” I asked.
Amy looked annoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have more sensible suggestions that
make trouble----!” she complained, but she
wrote this addition: “If this is as much as
spoke of, I shall leave!” And she said that she
was glad I’d thought of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “They always
mention leaving,” she said. “It’s as much a
part of modern servants as their uniforms. It
gives just <span class='it'>the</span> touch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, feeling very clever, we went to the
living-room, where we had lunch on a little table
before the fire. There was a man in the dining-room
arranging for new hangings, and I was
glad, for eating on the small table was fun and
cosy. That part of the day was nice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We talked to Ito as he served, and told him
how tired we got of nourishing food, and asked
him if there wasn’t something sweet in the
kitchen, beside the blanc-mange which aunt had
ordered for us. He thought so and vanished, to
return with fruit cake and meringues, which had
nothing to go in them, but which we accepted
with gratitude. Altogether it was a charming
hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy grew confidential. I suppose the fire-light
and the closed-in feeling that the rain
pattering on the windows gave us made that;
and she told me of her ambitions. She is going
to marry a millionaire who worships the ground
she walks on, and live on Fifth Avenue in the
biggest house there, and have Henry Hutt paint
her portrait, because she loves his kind of art.
And she said her husband would have her portrait
in a little room all lined with pink velvet and
put violets under it (the portrait, not the velvet)
every day. She has it all arranged. He is to
be a broker, and after coming home from down-town
he will go in that room, which Amy calls
his “Heart Sanctuary,” and kneel before her
picture. I asked why he didn’t kneel before <span class='it'>her</span>,
and she said she’d be off playing auction or at
the matinée. Then she ate her third meringue
and stared absently into the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is what you make it,” she said; and
then: “He is going to wear a checked suit and
a red tie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I couldn’t see him kneeling in that pink room
in that rig, but I didn’t say anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do with your future?”
she questioned, after an interval of silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told her I only asked to be allowed to climb
fences and ride and fish, and stay at home in
Queensburg. Then I realized I had not been
tactful, and tried to fix it up, but I couldn’t,
and our nice time was spoiled. Amy told me
that I was frightfully gauche and embarrassed
her and Evelyn a lot, and as for my staying
at home--it was only kindness of them to take
me out of it! And then she spoke of my new
clothes, which I did not think was nice, and told
me just how much Aunt Penelope had paid for
them. I felt myself growing white, as you do
when you are very hurt. And I told her I would
some day pay for those clothes, after which she
stopped speaking and looked embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry about that,” she said in a
moment. “Mother expected to have to do that
for you. She said she knew your things would
be frightful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought of Mrs. Bradly’s making them; and
all the weariness of the rain and the many miles
which lay between me and Queensburg sunk into
my heart and ached. I felt miserable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother is going to speak to you,” Amy
went on. “She hasn’t any time before Wednesday
morning, but she has you marked for then.
I saw it on her pad; ‘Natalie ten’ is on it. She
is going to ask you to be more careful of your
conversational topics. I suppose you know you
didn’t make a hit yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hadn’t supposed I had, but I didn’t know
I’d done anything very wrong. I said I was
sorry if I had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should be,” said Amy. “That description
of how wasps laid eggs annoyed Evelyn.
Someone else was talking about the Russian arts,
and you came in with that, and it sounded--queer.
Egg-laying is not a subject for afternoon
teas, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t see why not, but I didn’t say so.
What I did say was that I was sorry I had
annoyed Evelyn, and that some day, in some
way, I would pay them back all I was costing
them. Then I stood up and said I thought I
would go off and rest for a little while. My voice
sounded heavy and dull, as voices do when someone
has put out all your inside fire with the cold
douche of their disapproval. Amy shrugged her
shoulders and didn’t reply, and I went to my
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here I sat down and thought--sort of miserably.
We had had lights on in the drawing-room,
and the fire had cheered, but my room,
unlit, was gray and seemed chilly in spite of
being really warm. Then I tried to write Uncle
Frank and Bradly-dear, but I couldn’t. As I
tore up what I had written and turned away from
my small desk, my attention was caught by a
movement at the window. I saw the inner
drapery ripple and--that someone was hidden
behind it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I got up, shaking horribly and went to the
hall to call Ito. He was slow to answer my
ring, and when he at last did it was no wonder
that the curtain hid nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wind?” he said. I shook my head. Then
he looked around thoroughly, but nothing could
be seen. “Wind,” he said, and this time as a
statement, but I was not convinced, although I
let him think I was.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I heard Amy dressing
in the adjoining room, and I was glad she
hadn’t heard the noise or what it was about. I
asked Ito not to tell her, and then, because I
did not want to talk to her just then, put on a
plain gray sailor, a long coat, and my overshoes,
and started out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain had almost stopped and was beginning
to be a mist. I didn’t put up my umbrella,
but let it blow against my cheeks, and it helped
me. After I had walked eight or nine blocks I
began to feel better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not think Amy had been kind, but I began
to realize that her lack of it was not all her fault.
No one had ever seemed to have time to teach
her the rules--the rules that make you take a
beating without noise, and make you treat the
visiting team as if they were Royalty, and make
you shoulder your own mistakes. They would
have taught her to stand up to punishment, even
if it wasn’t hers, and bear this, unless the other
fellow was big enough to speak--and she would
have learned that it isn’t decent to give a person
things and then speak of the cost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bradly and Uncle Frank and baseball
taught me those things. And with all my heart
I am grateful that I have learned them. For
although knowing how to enter a room is nice,
knowing how to be square is of most importance,
and I am sure it should come first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I walked a long way. The streets were more
empty than usual, and I liked that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
gray skylights caught in the wet pavements,
which reflected everything, and it was pretty.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I began to feel very much better. On
my way home I found a woman selling violets,
and I bought a little bouquet for Mr. Kempwood.
It took all of two dollars which Uncle
Frank had sent me, but I was so glad to spend
it that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stopped at Mr. Kempwood’s going up.
Evelyn had just driven up in a motor, but she
was with friends whom I didn’t know, so I didn’t
wait. I don’t think, to be honest, that she
wanted me to, for she only looked quickly at me
and my violets, gave a casual wave, and turned
back to speak to the group in the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood had not gone down-town and
was glad to see me, and I took off my coat and
sat down with him before a fire. It seemed hot,
as indoors so often does after you have been
walking fast in the rain. I felt my cheeks grow
warm. He was very glad to get the violets and
put them in a little glass basket that shimmered
with hundreds of colours. He said they were
positively the nicest violets he had ever had, and
I could see that he really liked my bringing them
to him. I hadn’t dreamed that it would please
him so much, and I began to be honestly
happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while, without his knowing why I asked
it, I asked if he thought the mention of how a
certain sort of wasp laid eggs was wrong. And
I told him about how they did it, mentioning
Uncle Frank with pride. Uncle Frank, of course,
has taught me all I know of insect life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems this sort of wasp lays her eggs in the
back of caterpillars (the shaved varieties), and
they hatch there and eat the caterpillar, who dies,
which I think is sad, but clever of the wasp.
And I told him that I had heard of a country girl
telling this story at a tea and embarrassing people
to whom she was related, and why shouldn’t she,
and was it terrible? And didn’t he feel sorry for
the caterpillar?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered at length. He said that it was
perfect rot for anyone to be offended by that,
and why should they be? He grew quite angry.
“The world,” he said, “is full of fools, Nat.
You couldn’t say anything unpleasant, my dear.
It isn’t in you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t want him to know it was I, and I
thought I had fixed it so he wouldn’t, but he is
very clever!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can say anything,” he went on, “if
you look at it in the bright, true light of decency
and speak of it--aloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded, my eyes on him. “I know,” I
agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, I know you do,” he said, then
asked if he might smoke, and lit a cigarette. “I
think that’s an interesting story,” he continued,
after a few puffs, “and I’ll admit it’s clever of
Mrs. Wasp, but pretty hard on the amiable
caterpillar. Think of being out for a stroll and
having a day nursery grafted on you! And then
consider finding yourself a boarding-house and--on
top of that--being asked to supply meals at
all hours! I don’t blame the old boy for kicking
off. It would be simply <span class='it'>too</span> much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered how he could protect himself, and
Mr. Kempwood said he shouldn’t have shaved.
He said shaving made men lots of trouble, anyway,
and if this fellow had been wise and grown
a Van Dyke on his back, all troubles with the
adopted family would have been avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I said I must go, and stood up. “Do
you think,” I asked, “that Madam Jumel ever
had a servant who grew blind? Or did anyone
who was ever blind love her very much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard,” said Mr. Kempwood, “that one
of those French refugees went blind and that she
let him stay around the place, but don’t know
how much truth there is in it. Someone who
had known the coachman’s son said that this old
chap used to sit out near the back door and sing
peasant songs of his part of France and that he
worshipped old Madam Jumel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think
perhaps he missed Royalty and that she seemed
that to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway, it is said that he
swore he would do anything for her that she
asked, and that--blind or not--he would accomplish
what he set out to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was interested, and it was as I supposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you ask?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day perhaps I’ll tell you,” I responded,
“but not now----” And then I left.
As I started for my walk that day I had passed
the blind man, and for a space, in one empty
street, he had followed me. And as I returned
I found him sitting huddled up in a little dry spot
near the basement entrance of our building. I
meant to keep the bracelet. It was mine. But--keeping
it was beginning to be a terror-striking
matter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought of it, fearfully, I will
confess, as I went up to our apartment, but once
there all thoughts of Madam Jumel’s servant,
Madam Jumel, and my bracelet fled. For Evelyn
stood in the centre of the hall orating to Aunt
Penelope. She held an empty box in one hand
and the note Amy and I had written and signed
with Jane’s name in the other. And I then felt
the bluest spot in all that blue Monday.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XIV</span>--<span class='sc'>Evelyn Blames Me</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>She</span> did it,” said Evelyn shrilly, as I stepped
through the door. “I saw her carrying them.
She even had the assurance to smile at me and
wave! And as to this”--she waved the note--“that
is only what I would expect from a prying,
thieving chit who has had no upbringing, and
who is suddenly thrown among people of cultivation.
I----” She stopped, looked at the
empty box, and choked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope, who was looking awfully
baffled, stooped to pick up one of the stockings
that had fallen from the box. “What is this?”
she asked in a sort of vacant tone, and the question,
and all that tangled in its answer, evidently
enraged Evelyn, for she almost exploded with
rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she echoed. “<span class='it'>What is it!</span>
Ask <span class='it'>her</span>!” She pointed at me. “Ever since
she came,” she went on, “I have been bothered.
Amy never thought of doing a thing until she
appeared. Amy was always----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she stopped, for at that moment Amy
came in and diverted the talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know anything about this, Amy?”
asked Aunt Penelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy looked at the box and then at me.
“No,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should she?” asked Evelyn. “I told
you I saw the violets. I suppose she took them
to Mr. Kempwood; she’s insane about him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Silly little thing! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope you will make it
understood, mother, that if another thing like this
happens she will be shipped to her backwoods
town--to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t do it,” I said, but my voice shook,
and even to myself it did not sound convincing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t do it!” said Evelyn, and she
laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you get the violets?” asked Aunt
Penelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told her, and I looked at Amy, but her face
was hard, and she answered none of the appeal
I sent her for help. And at that moment I
began to hate her for a cheat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has helped herself to my bracelet too,”
Evelyn accused. “For two days it was gone,
and when it came back there was a dent in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t,” I whispered. “I honestly
didn’t.” But no one believed me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any ideas about who made off with
the violets?” asked aunt. “Who took the
bracelet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I had. And she asked who it was, and
I said I’d rather not tell. Then there was a
deep, unpleasant silence, and during this everyone
looked at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will have to have a very serious talk,”
Aunt Penelope said to me. “I think, Natalie,
you have allowed yourself to forget what you
owe us, the debt our hospitality has laid on
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I contested, as politely as I knew how, that I
had not. And I added that I had had nothing
to do with the violet theft, whatever else I was
mixed up in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to tell me,” demanded Evelyn,
waving the note we wrote, “that Amy had a
thing to do with this? I can’t believe it. You
didn’t, did you, Amy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again Amy said “No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too childish for her,” Evelyn continued
triumphantly. “She plays as good a game of
bridge as I do, mother, and she wouldn’t stoop
to this sort of action. That we leave to people
who accept everything and give nothing but
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In some way,” I said, “I am going to pay
you for everything”--and I could feel myself
growing steadily more white, for I was furiously
angry--“and I am going home,” I added,
“home where truth is believed and I am trusted.”
Then I looked at Amy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will take some blame about the paste,” I
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” said Evelyn coolly, her eyebrows
raised. “Why accept any, since lying doesn’t
seem to trouble you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t answer, and Aunt Penelope ran her
hand over her forehead and said, “Dear, dear!”
in a tried, worried way. Then the door-bell rang,
and Aunt Penelope, Evelyn, and Amy all became
quite everyday and tried to look usual. I stood
silent and ignored as Jane admitted Mr. Herbert
Apthorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said “Evelyn!” quite sharply and held
out his hands. You could see he cared for her
and was glad things were fixed, as I suspect they
were, and I think Evelyn was glad too, although
she didn’t show it so plainly. She only said:
“Oh, Herbert! Nice of you to come to see
us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let’s go in the living-room. I believe
there’s a fire there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Jane summoned Aunt Penelope
to the telephone, and Amy, quite naturally,
disappeared. I went down to see Mr. Kempwood,
for I was going to borrow the fares to go
home. But he persuaded me not to go, and in
this way, after I had told him as much as I
dared, without squealing on Amy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” he said, “if Washington had not
fought out the battle of Harlem Heights, New
York might be a British Possession to-day. But
courage and staying there saved the country and
won a battle. Just in that way a man has to
fight his battles through; he owes that to his
soul. After he has won--or tried to--going is
another matter. But you are not guilty; your
battle has just begun, and I think you ought to
stay here until you can leave without the shadow
of suspicion hurting you. Hoist your flag, wave
it hard, and stick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drew a deep breath. “If you think so, I
will,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he cheered me a great deal by saying,
“This is simply <span class='it'>rotten</span>!” and, “What’s the
matter with them?” I shook my head. After
that I stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go,” I said, “and change my clothes
for dinner. Aunt Penelope cannot excuse lateness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I need not have hurried, for I had my
dinner in my room. It was part of my punishment,
and everything was cold, but I didn’t mind.
I wasn’t very hungry. After I finished eating
I wrote Uncle Frank, but it wasn’t a good letter.
I told him about school starting the next week,
spoke about the weather, and a little, but not
much, about missing him (I didn’t dare tell him
how much I really did, for I knew it would make
him unhappy), and then I told him I looked at
the bug quite a good deal, which was true; and
after I finished the letter I got the little bug, put
it on my desk and studied it, and what it meant,
for quite a long while. And I think it helped me.
I didn’t feel any happier from this, but I felt more
courage. For if a mere bug could stand being
entombed for three years so that it might finally
blossom out with wings and a song, I thought I
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as I got up to put it on my bureau, I
heard a noise at the window. I drew a very deep
breath and then stopped breathing entirely for
a minute, after which I decided I would go to see
what was happening. For what Mr. Kempwood
had said about battles made me want to fight
mine very bravely. And I did laugh when I got
there, for on top of a broom and a floor-mop
which had been lashed together to make height,
was a package. It was tied there, and down
below, poking this up, was Mr. Kempwood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did a stage whisper, which I heard clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your room?” he said. “I never dreamed
it!” But he had known, for I told him I slept
over the little room which he used for an office.
“Unlash the ballast, Juliet!” he commanded,
and I did. Then I said: “I <span class='it'>wish</span> I could come
down!” He said he wished so too, smiled and
waved at me, and I said I’d send him a note
a little later on a string. Then I went inside and
undid the package. It held a wonderful box of
candy with enough pink ribbon on it for two
chemises, a copy of “Little Women,” and a
dear little box with an ivory kitten perched on
top. Inside of this he had a rhyme. It said:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>This Thomas Cat, the mop-post brings,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>Is well bred, calm, and never sings</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Upon a fence at night.</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>The box he guards is for Nat’s rings,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>Cuff buttons, studs, and other things</span></p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>And if, my dear, life cruel stings,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>Remember S. K.’s friendship clings</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>To you, all right!</span>”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Well, I liked that, and it cheered me up. And
below that I found a little wad of paper which
was twisted about a silver ring; it was a lovely
ring! The silver was so prettily fashioned and
held the amethyst so beautifully, and on this
paper was a line which said: “There’s a wish
on this. Put it on and see if it won’t come true.
I hope it will fit.” And it did. I was excited
and really happy! It was just like Christmas!
Then I sat down and wrote Mr. Kempwood and
ate candy as I did it. Life looked so much
brighter! I told him so, and how happy he’d
made me. Then I lowered this by a corset lace,
which was the only convenient lowering device
that I could find, and waited. He answered my
note promptly, and he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Nat</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your note made me very happy. I’d
give my entire apartment and its contents, any
day, to get a thank you note like yours! I know
things will smooth out soon; they can’t help it.
And meanwhile, if ‘a feller needs a friend’ she
has it, can’t help having it, in the apartment
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please sleep well to-night, small girl, for we
are going to the Hippodrome to-morrow afternoon
at 2.0. Now aren’t we?</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“Until then,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>“S. K.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I sent down one more note before I went to
bed. And because he had signed himself
“S. K.” I called him that. Mr. Kempwood
seemed too cold for the way I liked him. So I
wrote: “I would love to go, dear S. K.” And
I added: “<span class='it'>Thank you for everything!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I went to bed, wearing my new ring
and thinking a great deal about Mr. Kempwood
and the Hippodrome. And I almost forgot the
happenings of that afternoon, which at the time
had hurt fearfully.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XV</span>--<span class='sc'>What Occurred</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Christmas-time</span> in New York is simply
gorgeous, and I loved it. And it was then that
all the intense excitement started and that people
began to understand what had made me nervous;
but I must tell what happened before the holidays
came. For a good many things occurred which
proved to be notes in the chord of the big
mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more my bracelet disappeared and reappeared,
as it had before--at night. And this
time the scratching woke me from a sound sleep,
and, as before, I saw a tiny point of light caught
in the gold, and in this way watched it creep
about a foot inside of the room by my bed and
then stop. And this time, after it had rested for
a moment, it moved again with a jerk, for about
two inches. Then, very quietly, the door at the
head of my bed closed, and I heard the click of
the door-knob, after which the key fell from the
lock and clattered loudly on the floor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I lay there shaking and gasping, and wishing
that even Amy were with me. But Amy and I
were not good friends at that time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well,
that night I got up, switched on my lights, and
picked up the bracelet. I tried to be a sport,
and so I said, “Hello; glad to see you back!”
but my voice wasn’t the sort that should have
gone with those words. Then I put the bracelet
up and was just about to turn off the lights when
I heard my door open perhaps an inch and close
quickly. And I turned in time to see a hand
reach in to get the flashlight which lay on the
table by my bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shakily I said, “<span class='it'>Who is that?</span>” but no one
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I went to the door and looked out, but no
one was in sight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From down the hall I
could hear Uncle Archie snoring, and then Amy
coughed. Nothing was the matter with them.
I closed my door and locked it, although I did not
see what good locks would be against a force of
the sort I was meeting. But--it seemed safer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every sound from the street rose to bother
me and make me think that there was something
outside the door. Every creak in the furniture
made me jump. I sat huddled up in a big chair,
warmly wrapped in a blanket, but shaking as if
I had two hundred and nine chills all at once.
And every once in a while I would think I heard
a footstep in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this goes on,” I thought, “I do not see
how I can <span class='it'>stand</span> it.” And at that time I decided
to give up the bracelet and have peace. For
everything looks blacker at night, and in those
dark hours it is easy to give up and let yourself
be beaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half an hour after that, perhaps, I heard
the beginning of day in the whir of motors, and
nothing ever sounded so good to me. I wanted
light, most terribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as all things that seem as far away as
graduation, or your first low-necked dress, or
your first train, it eventually came, and then I
lay down, and slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I got up the next morning Aunt Penelope
was nice to me for the first time since she
thought I’d stolen Evelyn’s violets. That is, I
mean she felt like being kind. Before, she had
been elaborately polite, and as just as she could
possibly be, but I felt that this was because she
would be uncomfortable if she weren’t, not because
her instincts pointed my way with gentleness.
And I was so glad that I had to swallow
a great many times as fast as possible, and
couldn’t say good-morning to Uncle Archie, who
got in with his greeting first and “Huh-ed” at
me twice before I could respond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child,” said Aunt Penelope, “are
you ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I was all right, I guessed, but that I
hadn’t slept very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took my hands in hers and then laid a
hand on my cheek. “Hot,” she said. “Suppose
we stay home from school to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do a little petting of ourselves?” she
went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought that would be nice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amy will take a note to Miss Gardner,”
Aunt Penelope continued, “and we’ll be cosily
fixed at home and have Doctor Vance come in.”
And then she looked at me searchingly, patted
my hand and sent me to my place. I didn’t
eat much, I didn’t feel like it and I was too busy
thinking, for I had decided, with daylight, that
I would not give up. Uncle Archie got up,
before we had finished, as he always does, and
as he went by my place laid five dollars by it.
I did think that was dear of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked if I might be excused, and followed
him to the hall and here I thanked him. He
grunted and looked over my head, and you can
imagine my surprise when he said, “Guess
you haven’t been very happy, lately, have
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied that I supposed it was my fault if I
had not been, and then (I don’t know what made
me, for I had become used to having people
think wrong of me) I added, “<span class='it'>I did not take
those violets.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh----” he grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care enough for them,” I went on.
“I prefer daisies to orchids, just as I prefer
fishing to <span class='it'>thé dansants</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fishing,” said Uncle Archie, and he stared
down at the surface of the hall table, which shines
highly where it isn’t covered with a lovely piece
of brocade. “I used to fish,” he said, “but
my soul--that was a long time ago!” and he
sighed. I got the impression that he had liked it
lots, and I think it seemed to him as if it had
happened a long time past in his life and that
he had grown away from it in spirit too, and
somehow couldn’t go back. I felt very sorry
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I went back to the dining-room I found
Evelyn just trailing in, wearing a négligé and
looking pretty, but tired. She was fretful about a
frock that had not come when she expected it
and sat toying with her breakfast and complaining
about everything. And as always, when she
began this, Amy started to say that <span class='it'>she</span> had
nothing to wear, and that her clothes were the
worst looking in school and that she was ashamed
to go. And then she began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was disgusted, and I thought Evelyn ought
to be ashamed to start it, for bad temper is just
as catching as measles or mumps, and anyone
who gives it to the public should be punished in
some way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt looked tried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>is</span> the matter with you?” she asked.
“I never sit down that you and Amy don’t ask
for something, and I’m sure I don’t see where
you got that habit----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(I almost smiled at that.) Then she looked
at a little tiny diamond-trimmed wrist-watch she
wears, spoke sharply to Amy of the time, added
a word about her own engagements, and both
she and Amy left. Evelyn and I, who had not
finished eating, were alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I did an awful thing, but it was a satisfaction.
I told Evelyn just what I thought of
her. She started it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter with <span class='it'>people</span>?” she said.
“Sometimes they’re simply on edge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Here I come in, make a calm statement about
needing frocks, and Amy begins to cry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Anyone can see that I need more than a child
of her age does.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People are all pigs,” I said, “and want more
than they have and more and more and more,
and that is the reason you’re so unhappy. You
started the bad temper,” I continued (it really
was interesting, for she had let her mouth open
in astonishment, and astonishment evidently relaxed
the spring, for it stayed so), “and then--you
wonder what made it. Any girl like Amy
looks up to an older sister, and when the older
sister complains the entire time, why--she does
too! And that’s the reason,” I stated with
entire frankness, “that you’re going to miss
happiness. You think frocks and having things
makes it--well, things and frocks don’t. Responsibility
and love and giving make a return,
and they only.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Look here,” I paused for a
moment, and then went on, “Amy adores you,
she patterns herself over you; therefore she is
beginning to be cross to aunt and never to say
a decent thing at home and to complain <span class='it'>all the
time</span>. That’s what she sees in <span class='it'>you</span>----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” I hurried on before she could break
in, “she will miss real love, as you will, because
real love hasn’t enough money for motors and
frocks and all she wants. And I think real love
is lucky, for all he would get would be a request
for more money, complaints and no consideration.
Look at Uncle Archie,” I added, and I
went on at length about his caring for fishing
and never doing it and how he never sat down
to a meal without a request of some sort, from
one of them, for money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That whole business has soured this family,”
I said, “and I am glad you are not going to let
it sour another--since money is evidently most
important to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I left. Evelyn had plenty of time to
speak, but she didn’t; and what is more she
didn’t speak about it later, or tell Aunt Penelope
of what I had done. I know it was frightful of
me, but, as I said, it was a satisfaction, for I
had come in the library one afternoon hunting a
book and found Evelyn and Mr. Apthorpe sitting
there before a fire. The heavy rugs muffled my
footsteps and before I could speak and let them
know I was there, I heard, “Four thousand--oh,
Herbert, I don’t see how <span class='it'>we</span> could. I love
you, but how <span class='it'>could</span> we manage on that!” And
he hadn’t come to call since, so I knew how it
ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was what made me so mad--to see her
throw away that chance (for it was a big one if
she did care) because of greed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several weeks went by after that and everyone
but Evelyn was nicer to me. She wasn’t
unpleasant, but she didn’t notice me. The
Doctor said I was a little nervously upset, and
that commanded Amy’s respect and made the
girls in school splendid to me. Hardly a day
went by that I didn’t get gum-drops or a French
pastry or have someone offer to let me wear their
violets for a half-hour. I liked that. And more
for the spirit than for the benefits which I received
from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood was splendid to me all that
time and took me for lots of nice drives and to
the theatre several times. We became better
and better friends, and he began to seem less
old and more “S. K.,” a chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night he sent a new servant up to ask
if I cared to go walking with him before dinner.
I was in the dining-room helping Ito serve aunt’s
friends who had been playing auction and were
ready to be tea-ed up. When I hunted the man
to give him my answer I couldn’t find him, until,
looking down the long hall which leads toward
the sleeping-rooms, I saw him step from my
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon,” he said, as he reached me,
“but I heard a window go up in that room, and
then a heavy tool drop. It sounded like a sneak
thief and I went to see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The window was
open, miss, and there is a bit of wood broken
from the sill. I beg pardon if I did wrong, but
there seemed to be no one about but the party
of ladies and I thought immediate action necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said it was all right and thanked him. And
I found something he had not seen--and that was
that the lock of the window was broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone had been there, and with intent fixed
that window so it could be opened. It was the
one which led out on the little iron grilled balcony.
That was the night I set the trap. If I recall
correctly, it was the night before Thanksgiving.
But that doesn’t matter. What does matter was
that five people wore bandages on their right
hands the next day--so--how could I tell who
had found the trap?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing seemed to work out as I hoped it
would, everything only made more confusion;
and I felt--Madam Jumel smile!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XVI</span>--<span class='sc'>All Sorts of Bruises</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>S. K. suggested</span> the trap and I think he did
not really believe that my bracelet was ever
stolen, but thought that I imagined it was,
because I was at that time half sick from nervous
upset, which was not extraordinary, considering
everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put a mouse-trap in the box,” he suggested,
“and then, when you hear it shoot, you can
get up and chase Madam Jumel’s ghost with a
hair brush or a shoe tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said he was a silly thing and ignored the
chase suggestion. But, on the way home I
stopped at a small grocery and bought a mouse-trap,
and S. K., laughing quite a little, paid for
it. Then he asked me how he was to settle
with the landlord that month, muttered a good
deal about extravagant women, and went on to
say that we could easily locate the thief, by
the mouse-trap which would be clamped on his
first finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” he said, “if the thief is sufficiently
prominent, he will start a style and everyone will
be wearing them. Your aunt will be saying,
‘My dear, I’ve mislaid my mouse-trap and I’m
<span class='it'>late</span> now! Where <span class='it'>ever</span> can it be!’ ” And we
both laughed for half a block. It sounds silly,
but S. K. imitates beautifully and I could just
see Aunt Penelope running all over, hunting her
mouse-trap, while Jane stood around holding her
furs; and Ito and Amy helped hunt, and everyone
got excited and hot; for that’s the way she
does lose things and find them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. and I had been walking in the first snow-fall,
which was a feathery, dry affair that clung
and didn’t melt. It was really too cold to snow
at all, and the gray sky that was full of it had
a hard time letting it down to earth through the
intense dry cold that made a wall. Your cheeks
stung and grew pink and the flakes caught in
your hair and on your clothes. S. K. said that
snow was becoming to me and that I should
always wear it and I replied that I would be
charmed to in July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he said, “My dear, you’re growing up.
Your answers are becoming too quick and clever
for a sixteen-year-old chit. I won’t have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seventeen,” I responded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked when and I told him that morning
at four or thereabouts, for that was the hour at
which I was presented to society, according to
Mrs. Bradly, who has often told me what Chloe
told her of the event. My mother was very
pleased with me then and happy that my father
had a daughter. When someone said, “Your
eyes, Nelly, and your beautiful shade of hair!”
she whispered, “That’ll please Carter, for he
<span class='it'>seems</span> to like that sort!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a mean girl,” said S. K., and he
meant it. I apologized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would have had a party for you,” he went
on. “The mention in the social column would
have read: ‘Mr. Samuel Kempwood entertained
for Miss Natalie Page at his apartment--and so
on.’ Then, ‘Among those present were Miss
Natalie Page and Mr. Kempwood. The refreshments
were charming, and Mr. Kempwood
almost managed to save one slice of the cake
for his consumption, but the onslaught of----’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said he was unkind. Then we walked in
haughty silence for another half-block.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he said, after a side look at
me, “pretty soon, in two or three years, you’ll
be coming out. Then--think of the young idiots
with down on their upper lips who will fall for
you. Nat, I predict it, and--suppose you fell
for one of <span class='it'>them</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of it?” I asked. I enjoyed it
because I thought he was thinking how he’d miss
our friendship. It gave me a new, queer feeling,
which I suppose was power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t have it,” said S. K. irritably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Really?</span>” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I won’t,” he said again. And he
frowned and didn’t look at me. I melted. I
care for him awfully and I can’t tease him long.
For the sentence that always goes with the slipper
and spanks is awfully true when I hurt S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I slipped my arm through his and squeezed it
tight against me. “Don’t you know,” I said,
“that I’ll never like anyone as well as I do you,
S. K. dear?” And I went on to tell him of
all he’d done for me, how he’d saved me from
running away from the firing-line, and made the
firing-line a very pleasant place--in spots, and
how much his teaching me history and helping
me with my studies had helped, and how greatly
his different interests had developed me. And
I ended with: “If I ever do marry, you can pick
out my husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fumbled for my hand, closed his around it
hard, shook it, and said, with a funny little tight
laugh: “It’s a go!” And then he was most
awfully jolly, in a sort of excited way. I didn’t
understand it then, but I liked him even more
than usual, and so enjoyed the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had come from the Jumel Mansion, where
we had seen General Washington. That is, we
pretended we did. I often went to the Jumel
Mansion, and S. K. sometimes went with me.
I was glad, for he helped to make it, and the
people who had lived in it, real to me. I had a
paper to write about New York at the time of
the fire, its life, development, and so on, and of
course Washington came in it, and S. K.’s
imagination made it get the Freshman prize.
I felt mean about taking it, although he said
what I had put in was original and not from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I told our English teacher that Mr.
Kempwood had helped me by talking facts to me,
Amy was in the room, and that night she said:
“You always try to be truthful, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “Yes,” without looking at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she looked at the ring S. K. had given
me, which I wear all the time. (Aunt Penelope
said I could keep it because he was so much
older.) “Do you think men like truthful girls?”
Amy asked next. Her voice was small. I said
I thought they did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do they know you’re not truthful?”
she asked next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know there’s a drop of ink in
a glass of water?” I counter-questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it shows?” she asked slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I felt sure that it did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the loss of faith in those to whom you
have lied,” I answered. I hated to hurt her,
but I thought she deserved it, and it was the
truth. I had lost faith in her, and after that
occurrence about the violets I could not trust
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t the first little lie,” I said, “that
counts so much; by that you only hurt yourself.
But it’s the ripples from it that make the cruelness.
You see, you take the trust out of the
hearts of your friends, and for a substitute you
give four words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are those?” asked Amy, fingering the
fringe that hung from her overskirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You Can’t Trust Her,” I said. Then Amy
picked up a copy of <span class='it'>Vogue</span> and pretended to look
at it, and I turned the pages of the <span class='it'>London Sporting
and Dramatic News</span>, which is not so entirely
given to lingerie and portraits of Lady Something.
I like pictures of dogs because I know
their points, and I found a double page of setters,
which I studied with interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think Amy tried to say that she was sorry
about her lies, but I think she couldn’t. And
I’m glad she didn’t, for I would have had to tell
her that the only way to right a wrong is to try
to undo it, and she wasn’t ready to do that at
that time. That took a long thinking to accomplish,
and a place in the centre of the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to go back to the afternoon of mouse-traps
and General Washington study, as I
said, we visited the Mansion; and “Washington’s
Headquarters” it was, most truly, that
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you smell something good?” asked
S. K., as we stood in the hall. I shook my
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stupid-nosed girl!” he said. “A huge cut
of beef is roasting before the basement fireplace.
It is on a spit, and it is being turned now and
again by a fat, hot cook. There’s chatter below
stairs. For this night President Washington is
to give a large dinner party, and the house which
was once Roger Morris’, and is now but a farmhouse,
is to hold American celebrities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Listen to the clatter on the stairs; it is a waiter
in a blue satin coat and white satin breeches.
He is carrying wine-glasses, because those were
the good old days before anybody thought Loganberry
was good for anything but painting the
barn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” said S. K. I did, and then, in a
loud voice, he said: “By King George’s beaten
rascals, I’ve forgot the serviettes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I seemed to see the waiter say this and
hear him clatter toward a high dresser which held
the linens.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. S. K. told me about how they
set the table, and he told me the date of this
dinner, which was July 10, 1790. And then I
had a list of the guests, who were President
Washington’s Cabinet “and Ladies”: John
and Abigail Adams, the Vice-President and his
wife; Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State;
Henry Knox, Secretary of War, and his wife;
and Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the
Treasury, and his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad to see Alexander Hamilton,” said
S. K., squinting in the room (we pretended, of
course, that their ghosts were back a-dining),
“for he has done so much for America. He it
was who saw that the United States must have
a central power and central Government. (My,
how the individual States did disagree after the
war, how their trade restrictions did hamper and
hurt the bigger trades and the good of the
country!) He it was who got up the Constitution;
and Mr. Jefferson, who sits across the
table, the Declaration of Independence. Pretty
nice things both of them, you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“President Washington is speaking,” said
S. K. “He has just told the servant to be
lighter on his heavy-soled shoes (this in an aside),
and then, as a good host, quickly diverts attention
by mentioning a recollection.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘To
think,’ he says, ‘that in September, 1776, I
watched from this point the burning of the city
of New York. It was an awesome and most
fearful sight!’ (He pauses; I think he gives
thanks that all the horrors of war are past.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And how many houses were burned, if it
pleases you to make reply to a foolish woman’s
question?’ This from Mrs. Knox. President
Washington says that it pleases him ‘most
mightily’ to answer whatsoever question Mrs.
Knox may ask him, and replies that one thousand
houses went in that terrible affair, and that that
number was a fourth of the city’s mansions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So vast a place,’ says Mrs. Hamilton. ‘I
am wellnigh distracted when I wander the
crowded streets, thinking I may never return
from whence I started!’ ‘We are growing,’
says Thomas Jefferson. ‘Our United States
population is nearing three million nine hundred
thousand, and New York now boasts high of its
last census, which states that thirty-three
thousand live within its confines.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laughed, and S. K. smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think of it,” I said, and then asked what
New York’s population is now, and S. K. told
me that in 1910 it was four million seven hundred
and sixty-six thousand, and that New York State
held over nine million souls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then S. K. told me that Hamilton was buried
in Trinity Churchyard, and that Trinity Church
was caught in the big fire, and rebuilt twice since,
but that St. Paul’s had been saved. He told
me he’d take me to both places some day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we started home, and I set my trap and
got into riding things, for I had begun in the
latter part of September to ride each day. I
wondered about wearing my bracelet and decided
not to. I remember I put it in the bottom drawer
of my bureau under a clean petticoat and a crêpe
de chine chemise. Then I started out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crowd from school ride together, and with
us is a man who cares for us. I don’t like going
their pace, and so I was almost relieved when
my mount bolted and got ahead of them. The
day was lowering and, although the sort I liked,
not, I imagine, a general favourite, for the drive
was almost empty. My horse did not throw me,
but a man who pretended to stop him pulled him
cruelly, made him dance, and the mock-hero,
while pretending to help me, pulled me off my
saddle. I was thrown on the ground until I was
dizzy, and then I felt hands on my arms, and
heard someone whisper: “Where’s the bracelet?”
The crowd drew near at that moment, the
man accepted thanks, and before I could speak
or detain him was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop him!” I shouted. “Stop him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the policeman who had drawn near soothed
me with “He don’t want no thanks, little lady.
He just wanted to do you a good turn, and Lord
knows what would of happened if he hadn’t
stepped out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he gone?” I asked miserably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” said the officer, smiling. I suppose
he thought I was a sentimental young person and
wanted to call him “my hero!” I didn’t; I
wanted to have him gaoled!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shaking a good deal, I remounted and rode
on. I decided I would finish my ride, although
I was bruised and frightened. It was no ghost
that had pulled me from that horse. I felt the
impression of his fingers for hours afterward, and
they were strong and real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to bed soon after dinner that night, and
at about nine Jane brought me in a huge box,
all covered with white tissue and wide pink
ribbons. It looked very festive, and I could
hardly wait to get it open and when I did--well,
it was just like S. K. That is all I can say about
it and--enough!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a birthday cake with tiny pink candles
all over it, and even a box of matches lying by
the side, ready to do the work. Under this was
a card, and it held S. K.’s wishes, written in a
dear way, which made me very happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I couldn’t cut that birthday cake alone and
eat a piece; I wouldn’t have enjoyed it. And
so, in spite of Evelyn’s coolness to me, I went
to her room, where she was confined with a
cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evelyn,” I said, “it’s my birthday, and
S. K. sent me a cake. I would love bringing it
over here and eating it with you--if you wouldn’t
mind?” She didn’t speak. I felt sorry for her,
for since Mr. Apthorpe stopped coming she has
not looked happy, although she has not been so
sharp or complained so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly I heard myself say: “I am sorry I
said all that; I had no business to. You are all
being very kind to me and giving me so much
that I should never think of your lacks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right,” she said. And then--in
a lower voice: “You know it was true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head. “Not lately,” I added to
the shake. And then I again asked if I might
bring over the cake, and she said yes. So I went
back, got into a heavier bath-robe, lit all the
candles, and triumphantly carried it to Evelyn’s
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I thought of Uncle Archie, found he was
home, and we sent an invitation to him. He
came sauntering in after several moments, looked
at the cake, grunted “Huh! Where’d you get
it?” and sat down. And I never, up to that
time, had such a good time in that apartment.
That began them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We laughed, and Uncle Archie talked, and it
was all as jolly and cosy as could be. I curled
up on a window seat near the radiator, Uncle
Archie sat down before Evelyn’s dressing-table
and actually pretended to do his hair (he hasn’t
any), and Evelyn sat up in bed and laughed--between
blowing her nose. And we laughed and
talked and ate cake and looked at the flickering
pink tapers a-top my cake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a half-hour of this Uncle Archie stood
up. “Father,” Evelyn said, with a little hesitation
and some embarrassment, “I wish you’d
come again--like this. I promise never to ask
you for a thing in this room!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his big hand on her head and said,
“When I can, I like you to ask me. It’s only
when I can’t that it hurts.” And before me I
saw those two people run up the curtains that
hid their souls, and begin to understand each
other. Evelyn looked up at him, and suddenly
she held the back of his fat, pudgy hand against
her cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” she said, “I hope that perhaps
we can come to be pretty good friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grunted and left. But I knew he felt a
lot and didn’t dare to do more than grunt, and
after he went Evelyn blew her nose very hard.
Then she lay back and silently we watched the
little flames of the candles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People are such fools,” she whispered. I
nodded, still staring at the points of light. I had
looked at them so long that they almost hypnotized
me. It was really difficult to look away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke abruptly next, and loud. “You
were right,” she said, “in what you said that
day. I have been fretful and cross and my
standards have been wrong. And--all the wrongness
of them is hurting me now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Then,
with gaps and funny interludes of the old, critical,
little part of Evelyn, she told me that Herbert
Apthorpe didn’t like her any more, that he had
been hurt by her not being willing to marry him
because she considered him poor, and that he
hadn’t answered a note in which she said she was
sorry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him,” she ended, “last week with
Charlotte Brush, I suppose----” Then her voice
trailed off as she stared up at the ceiling. Her
arms were above her head and her hair spread all
over the pillow in heavy chestnut waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must care,” I said, getting up and
coming over to sit on the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you are so beautiful,” I answered,
“and your spirit would be too, if you’d let it.
You are dear when you want to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?” she asked with interest,
as she turned her eyes on me. I was afraid she
would be annoyed, but she wasn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why lately,” I said, “no one could have
been more lovely----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to you,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I didn’t blame her, that I had been
presuming and I knew it. For I had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You helped me,” she said, and then she
began to cry. “I am going to do my best,”
she whimpered, between really big sobs, “and
be nice at home anyway--but I wish--I wish I
had had sense enough to measure when----”
She didn’t finish, but I knew what she meant.
I put my arms around her and she sat up and
let her head rest on my shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get this cold,” she whispered, after
her sobs had a little quieted. I said I didn’t
care. And then she kissed me. And I knew
we were friends for always; the sort of friends
that are tight enough to scrap and stand it,
disagree and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little while more I left, because we both
began to be embarrassed from the manner in
which we had revealed what was way inside.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I went to bed thinking of families and of how often
they neglect opportunities to know and love each
other. I thought of Uncle Archie and Evelyn
and then I thought how lucky I had been, for
ever since I was three Uncle Frank had loved
me, ever so hard; sometimes very absently, to
be sure, but I always knew he cared and I think
he knew I did. Before I slept, he always came
in to sit on the edge of my bed and once and
again he’d forget why and then he’d say, “Ho
hum, what am I here for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I’d say, “Good-night, Uncle Frank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he’d say, “Ho hum! To be sure!”
and add “Good-night.” Then from the doorway
he would say, “Ho hum, I love you,” and
I would whisper, most always very sleepily, “I
love you----” and I drifted away on that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I was tiny, Chloe began to send me to
sleep with the remembrance that I loved someone
and someone loved me, and I did it to Uncle
Frank when I came, and that started it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Perhaps some people might have thought it
funny to hear a bent-shouldered man with a long
beard say, “Ho hum.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love you,” but
it was never funny to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will always see him outlined against the light
from the hall--and silhouetted in that way in
my door, and when I do, I hear his voice telling
a sleepy little child that she was loved. And I
know it was not funny. It was beautiful.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XVII</span>--<span class='sc'>Who Caught the Mouse-Trap?</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> night after my birthday party, at which the
hostess was clothed in pink pyjamas and a coral
bath-robe and one of her guests wore a crêpe de
chine nighty, I slept badly. In the first place I
was bruised and sore from my fall and in the
second, frankly frightened. I kept imagining
that I heard things, as you do when the lights
are out and the world is still outside. My
furniture creaked as the damp, night air crept
in. A board snapped, then my radiator clanked.
I used my flashlight about two hundred and
eight times and then, ashamed of myself, lay
back and decided I would go to sleep and not be
silly. And I did go to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I awoke it was quieter than ever and
very still, but I knew by the goose-flesh, hot-and-cold,
choked sensation I had, that I had
been awakened by something foreign, perhaps
a noise that should not have been, and that I
was not alone. I lay shaking, but with my
eyes closed, and then I felt a light flash across
my face. I stirred, sighed as you do when half-awake,
and turned. Then I heard footsteps near
my bureau and a gently, sliding noise which was
the drawer being pulled out. I stealthily reached
for my night light, but it had been set off the
table on the floor--put of my reach. And my
flashlight was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did some quick thinking; in fact I don’t know
how I got all the reasoning I did in those few
minutes, but somehow it went in. I reasoned that
if I called I would be hurt before anyone could
reach me, and that I had no chance to get up
and get out of the room--alive. And I decided
that if the bracelet was the only thing wanted, I
would not be hurt if I kept quiet; so I adopted
the policy of possums and lots of the little grapevine
insects that look so much like twigs or a
bit of leaf--and lay still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard the trap snap and a muttered word that
is absolutely unquotable, and I had to smile,
even then! And I was fearfully frightened--almost
sick from fright to be truthful. Then I
turned again and sighed and I <span class='it'>heard</span> the man,
woman, or whatever it was, grow quiet. Absolutely
<span class='it'>heard</span> he, she, or it, hold its breath, wait in
suspense, and the silence of the moment was
louder than lots of noises. It simply throbbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a soft noise and I saw a dark
form in front of the window, heard a scratch of
a heel going over the sill and something scratch.
I coughed, there was a quick movement from
the window, and I knew I was alone. It was a
cloudy night, with the air still threatening snow
and the court is dusky even in daytime, so I could
not even get an outline of the intruder, which I
wanted and so greatly needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard a scuffle outside, as if someone were
sliding down against bricks, and then there was
silence, throbbing silence once more, which
seemed loud as it so often does at night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I lay very still for several moments, perhaps it
was many minutes; I don’t know, for I was sick
and shaking and I imagine half-fainting, because
the bed seemed to be floating. Even then, I
was ashamed of myself for my lack of courage.
When I at last got my nerve back, I sat up,
wiped my forehead, which was wet, mopped off
my cold, damp palms, and felt around for my
night light. I found it, about a yard from my
bed, and after I set it back I lit it and looked
around. Nothing was disturbed, but I found that
the trap was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I thought, “I have you now----”
and I stood looking down at the empty box, and
smiling--but I missed it. Something was disturbed.
A piece of wood was torn from the
window-sill, a great piece which had been started
in a jag by the holes made that night of the
rappings, and on the remaining splinters of this
was a piece of cloth, quite evidently torn from
clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were only a Sherlock!” I thought, as
I held it. I didn’t dream it would ever really
help, but I put great faith in the scar that a
trap would leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that I went over to sleep with Amy.
She moved as I crawled in by her, but didn’t
wake. I was glad that I didn’t disturb her,
for she had been to a party the night before
which lasted longer than my birthday affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning Amy got up without waking
me and at ten aunt came in to sit down on the
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t sleep very well?” she asked, eyeing
me quite anxiously, I thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I hadn’t, very.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um----” she mused, and then: “Well,
we’ll have a nice breakfast in bed after you’ve
been in the tub. Use those bath salts the doctor
gave you, dear--very relaxing. And I’ll hunt
something for you to read.” She was very nice
to me and I did so appreciate it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evelyn wanted you to go driving with her;
she’s decided to go out to-day; but I wouldn’t
let her call you. Got up and had breakfast
with her father this morning for some reason.
Usually we don’t see her before ten on Sundays,
but the young mind is a riddle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you
think you can go to sleep again after breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I’d try.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send Jane in to get you a fresh nightdress
and to help you bathe,” said aunt as she
stood up, and then she patted my cheek, murmured
something of an engagement, and left.
When Jane came in I nearly fainted. She had
her right hand done up, and she told me she
had run an ice-pick into her second finger and
that it “hurt something fierce.” I thought she
was pretty cool about it, for at that time I was
sure it was Jane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t know the cook let you touch the refrigerator,”
I said, as I kicked off my slippers
and stepped in the tub.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane, who was picking up my nighty, explained
that the cook had been out and that she was
entertaining a “gentleman friend,” who had
brought a bottle of beer with him. And that
sounded queer to me. It isn’t just the thing one
would pick out for an offering to Love, and
besides it is not as common as it once was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s lucky to have it,” I said, and then:
“Do you like ice in beer? I didn’t know people
usually put it in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane grew pink and she looked at me appealingly.
I couldn’t soften, for I knew I must get
whatever clues I could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people likes it in,” she said lamely
and then went to get me a fresh nightdress and a
négligé of Amy’s that Aunt Penelope had told
her to let me wear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brushed my hair and tied it with great
bows of wide pink ribbon and then tucked me
into bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jane,” I said, “haven’t I always been good
to you? I’ve tried to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always have been, miss,” she answered.
“You have a pleasant way with yuh, and Ito
and me is always saying how different you are
from Miss Evelyn and----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind about that,” I said. “But if
you ever wanted anything very much I hope you
would come to me and ask for it--or tell me
about it--instead of borrowing whatever you
liked for especial occasions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what maw always called it,” she said,
“just borrowing. She took in elegant washes
and we kids wore them clothes regular. We
certainly missed maw when she died!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane wiped her eyes, and although I felt sorry
for her I did want to smile. She <span class='it'>mixed</span> things so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you like the bracelet,” I asked boldly,
“and simply want to wear it occasionally--borrow
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What bracelet?” she asked, but she coloured
hotly. I gave up. I’d tried to give her a chance,
but I saw she wasn’t ready to surrender without
war. After a few more moments of puttering
and making me comfortable, she left and I lay
thinking how it could be solved. Then Ito came
in with a wicker breakfast tray which stood on
little legs, and on this was a pink china breakfast
set which was cheerful and easy to eat from.
Ito had put a rose between the folds of my
napkin and I was pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so pretty, Ito!” I said. “I wasn’t
very hungry, but I am now----” and then I
stopped, my eyes glued to his hand, the right
one, which was bandaged. I gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve hurt yourself?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ito grinned widely. “Everybody have
bandage,” he remarked pleasantly. “Jane
have ice-pick in finger, I sharp knife for benefit
of steak and make mistakes in direction. Everybody
stabbed to bleed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I giggled a little, it seemed so funny. “Who
else?” I asked in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Evelyn shut hand in motor door, it
smash open,” he went on. “Mr. Kempwood
new servant hurt hand to cut on bottle that is
fall to floor and break. All is hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I was sorry for them, but started laughing.
Ito joined me, and just at that moment
Evelyn appeared “Have you seen Amy?” she
asked. I said I hadn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had to go to the doctor’s the minute she
got up,” Evelyn explained. “She didn’t say
a word to anyone about it, but was awfully game.
It seems she got up to close a window last night--the
wind was frightful, you know--and she was
half asleep, I imagine, and fumbled it, for the
window came down on her fingers and she was
really hurt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What, your hand too, Ito?”
And she began to laugh with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no one had the full appreciation of the
joke that I had. It really was funny, although
it did disturb me. I began to believe it was
Jane. But I looked at the sample of cloth that
had caught on my window-sill and wondered why
Jane would wear that sort of a suit at night, and
why she would go out on the balcony when she
might have left more easily by my door? For
while the balcony does lead past Amy’s room to
the pantry window, my door is the first on the
hall which belongs to the sleeping part of the
apartment, and to leave by that would mean
running no risks of encountering anyone’s wakefulness
on return. I remembered the scratching
noise and wondered whether I had heard it--what
it meant? But I wasn’t to know for some
time after that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next week was quiet, but the week
after----! Words fail! There should be one
word that implies hair standing on end, cold
chills, shaking knees, goose-flesh, and a heart
going about twenty-seven thousand hard whacks
to the minute. I could use that word. I really
<span class='it'>could</span>, and--I need it!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XVIII</span>--<span class='sc'>Heart Affairs</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>About</span> that time things began to stir for Christmas.
Packages came in at all hours, and it was
understood that they weren’t even to be felt, and
that only the person to whom they were addressed
could open them. The weather man was evidently
in a good humour, for he predicted “dry,
fair weather with light south winds,” and, of
course, almost the greatest blizzard that New
York had ever known appeared to make the landscape
match those snow-scene Christmas-cards
with shiny silver on them that drops off. And
we had a splendid time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shops were simply gorgeous with their
red and green decorations, and people carried
packages, looked tired, but smiled. It was the
greatest fun in the world to go out on Saturday
mornings and scrunch through the snow to the
subway, and then delve into the crowds, who
laughed and pushed and hurried with such good
nature. Amy and I could hardly wait for school
to close. And in school notes simply flew, all of
them containing confidences about the furs the
writer hoped to get, or the ostrich-feather fan she
<span class='it'>knew</span> she was going to get, having seen the long
package on the hall table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope told us to make notes of what
we wanted, and it was what we did the Saturday
afternoon I met Mr. Apthorpe. Evelyn, who
had not been awfully well since she had that bad
cold, sat in the living-room with Amy and me,
and we were enjoying being together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to ask for a Russian sable coat,”
said Amy, who was sucking the point of her
pencil and looking down at the pad she held,
“because I think it is a duty to look for the
best. Some poet--I’ve forgotten who--said:
‘Hitch your waggon to a star.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn said that one would be a falling
star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But perhaps you could persuade father that
I <span class='it'>need</span> one,” Amy went on. “You have a tactful
way and seem to be very chummy with him
lately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Baby!” said Evelyn (Baby is the family
pet name for Amy), “you should be ashamed
of yourself! Why don’t you give father a
Christmas present of not asking for the impossible
and not whining for what he can’t give
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy’s face was a study in amazement. “But
you----” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have reformed,” said Evelyn, and then she
went back to her lists. She was working hard,
figuring out how little she dared give people who
had entertained her. Amy looked at her, then
she scribbled a note and passed it to me, pretending
it was a list of girls in our school that
we were going to ask to tea during the holidays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is mourning for Herbert,” she had
written. I nodded and felt ever so sorry for
Evelyn. She had been very kind and unnatural
for ever so long, and it was plain that something
had made a big dent in her feelings. She was
ashamed of the way she had let sharpness grow
on her, you could see that, and I think she was
going through a lot in realizing how unpleasant
she had often been, and trying not to be so any
more. In a way, any reform is an operation, for
you yourself cut out something that was wrong
and didn’t belong in you, and even a skilled
surgeon hurts you when he cuts off anything that
shouldn’t grow on you. I know, for I had a
wart removed. My simile is somewhat mixed,
but I still shine most brilliantly in athletics. I
became right forward and captain of our basket-ball
team after one game, but that is beside the
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we had written our lists and had had
tea and discussed where the tree should be set,
I said I wanted to go walking, and asked if anyone
else did, and, after they refused, I started
out. It was lots of fun to walk, because a little
thaw had made a sheet of ice over everything,
and going was a difficult matter. You had to
slide on every little incline, and I stood in our
apartment-house door for quite a while watching
those who strolled and--slipped. They would
mince along and then--zip! They’d go for perhaps
five feet and end up by doing a bunny-hug
to a tree that stands by the alleyway gate. And
as I stepped forth, I, too, slid and--into Mr.
Herbert Apthorpe. He tried to steady me,
almost lost his balance, and then we laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Evelyn’s cousin,” I said, as I walked
by him (I made his direction mine); “I suppose
you’ve forgotten me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said he hadn’t, to be polite, but I knew
he had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were speaking of you to-day,” I went
on. “Evelyn hasn’t been well, and she said she
wished you would come up.” I stole a side look
at him and saw that his face looked stiff and that
his eyes were steadily fixed ahead. He didn’t
look encouraging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am flattered,” he said; and the way he
said it made the snow-banks warm little nesting-places
in comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew he wasn’t at all flattered, but just said
so to let me know he wasn’t. I tried a little more
finesse, and it didn’t work, and then--I dropped
tact, which has never done a thing for me but
make me trip, and relied on crude truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you like Evelyn?” I asked. I was
sure he did, or I wouldn’t have said what I then
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very charming girl,” he said stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you hurt her?” I asked. He
looked at me after that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” he asked. I repeated my question.
And he echoed it in a vacant way, only putting
“I” in place of “you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do,” I assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he spoke, quickly, to the point, and in
a way that left no doubt as to how he felt. “She
turned me off,” he said, “because I hadn’t
enough money. Left me in no doubt about how
she felt and how much she valued what I offered
her. That didn’t seem to count. The fact that
my salary is modest did.” And after that he
walked so fast that I almost had to run to keep
up with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she were sick,” I said, “wouldn’t you
stick to her, help her--do anything you could
for her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think he considered me an interfering chit,
as I was, and hated me; but he couldn’t very
well strangle me, and I could walk quite as fast
as he, so he replied, crisply, coolly, as before,
but replied: “Since it interests you,” he answered,
“certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I explained that she was sick. I said
she had lived in a place where money was thought
most important, and among people who attached
a false value to it. And I said that that had
made her sick mentally and that he should give
her a chance and help her through that quite as
he would through anything that made her body
as miserable. He stopped and faced me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is changing,” I said. “She is sorry,
and she has cried before me about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught his breath and then said: “Oh,
my <span class='it'>dear</span>!” But he wasn’t speaking to me, I
knew, but to Evelyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s at home,” I went on, “and alone, or
will be, since you can order Amy off. And she
will love seeing you. She has cared so much
that I think that has kept her from getting over
this cold. I know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t speak, but gripped my hand, and
then he turned and hurried back toward the place
where we had met. And I knew where he went
from there, before I got home, and Amy told me
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on feeling sort of silly. The whole
thing had taken lots of nerve, and if I hadn’t
cared so much for Evelyn I never would have
done it. I hate explaining what I think about
the values of love and things. It makes me feel
wishy-washy. So I was glad to be diverted by
meeting S. K. He was in his car, and leaned
out and told me to get off the grass!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see the signs?” he asked, as
I turned to see where the loud order came
from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in here,” he ordered next, and then his
chauffeur, who grins and seems more human
than other people’s chauffeurs, helped me across
the snow-bank, and I was by S. K. He asked
me if I’d minded the heat, and how many vanity
cases I expected Santa to give me, and then he
said he had got me a present and that I’d better
sit tight or he’d give it to the janitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at his chauffeur’s uniform and asked
him where he got his servants’ duds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rogers Peet,” he replied. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too young to know, S. K.,” I replied.
“All of them--Debson’s too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of them,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had found out one more thing. “How did
your man cut himself?” I asked next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On a piece of Baron Stiegel glass, worse
luck,” S. K. answered. I felt sorry, for that
glass was manufactured by Baron Stiegel way
back, ages ago. He lived in South-Eastern
Pennsylvania, and the glass is interesting from
the historic as well as artistic viewpoint. S. K.
has lots of things of that sort that are interesting
as well as beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll go riding, we won’t go home,” said
S. K. next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I would go, and we turned toward Riverside
Drive, which was lovelier than ever with the
snow weighting down the boughs of the trees,
and the banks of the Hudson glittering like white
mountains across the way. Little tots, many of
whom wore red coats, made bright spots in the
snow, and their nurses added the black lines that
have to be to make a perfect poster. I loved it
and so did S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huge motors, with beautiful women in them,
rolled softly with and by us, and some of the
windows of the houses and apartments were beginning
to be bright with early lights. We were
quiet because it made you feel that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love this,” I whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” S. K. answered, “I do too.”
Then he looked down at me, and I was warmed
by the feeling that he liked me a great deal. He
had begun, even at that time, to be quite as much
a part of my life as Uncle Frank, who, in his
funny, forgetting way, has been both mother and
father to me ever since I can remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next summer,” said S. K., “I am going to
Southampton when your aunt does, and I shall
return to town when she does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Archie may be jealous,” I answered,
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. started to speak, then stopped, rubbed
his hands together, looked away from me, and
frowned. I looked at the beautiful houses, the
crowds, and the passing cars. The little stretch
of park, the wonderful apartments, and the well-dressed
people, made a picture, a picture of
happiest, smoothest-living New York. It was
pleasant to look on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose,” suggested S. K., “we go in up
here and have tea? I imagine you’ve had it once,
but I also suppose that hasn’t dimmed your bright
young appetite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I giggled, for it hadn’t. And after we had
driven some distance more, we turned in a big
house that is set high on a lot of ground where
you can get very good tea and wonderful things
to eat between drinks. We had scones, and
marmalade, and little cakes that were about as
big as big candies and which, like those, came
in cases. I ate quite a lot. S. K. telephoned
aunt about where I was, and we lingered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I grew confidential after I ate, and told S. K.
about Evelyn and Mr. Apthorpe. I hoped he
would think it was all right, and he did. He
said he wished someone would Cook Tour his
affairs like that, and something honestly hurt
under my left ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours?” I said, before I knew that I was
going to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think I’m too old?” he asked, in a queer,
tight way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said it wasn’t that, and then I told the truth.
“I suppose,” I said, “I am a pig, but I would
feel awfully if you got married. I don’t know
how I could stand it, S. K. I am awfully used
to you and your friendship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned across the table, covered my hand
with his, squeezed it in a way that reassured me,
and said: “I promise I won’t get married until
you say I can. How about that? You know I
am to choose your husband, so your having a
little say is only fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laughed, for I’d forgotten about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then S. K. said: “I beg pardon, Nat; I
seem to have borrowed your hand. Perhaps
you’ll want it to-morrow.” After which he
folded my fingers up and laid my hand in my
lap. I love his nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a good time, and he told me about
Madam Jumel’s marriage. The talk had run in
that direction, and that, I suppose, started
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It seemed that she was a great flirt,
and I think M. Jumel did not think she would
make a good wife, for although he made love to
her, S. K. said, he did not ask her to marry him.
But on one occasion, when Stephen Jumel returned
to his home after a little absence, he found
that Eliza Bowen was ill and, the doctor said,
dying. He went to her bedside, where the lady
besought him to marry her. S. K. didn’t tell
me why she wanted to be married so much, but
I suppose she wanted “ ‘Mrs.’ on her tombstone,”
as we say in Queensburg. Anyway,
M. Jumel was so touched that the priest then
and there married them, and--the next day
Eliza Bowen Jumel arose from her bed, and went
driving in high state. She wasn’t really sick
at all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of that, Nat?” S. K.
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I didn’t think it was entirely upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, my dear,” said S. K., reaching for
a buttered scone, and then he went on to tell me
how she had robbed Stephen Jumel, who, during
his absence abroad, had given her power to
administer his affairs. And how, when he came
back, he found himself a poor old man and a
dependent. I said it was sad, and I hated
Madam Jumel’s being buried by one of the most
beautiful drives in all America, and having a
splendid monument (we had seen it before we
had tea), while her husband’s grave is in one
corner of a little churchyard, neglected and
worn, and so hurt by time that only “Stephen”
is left to remind one of a name that once was
famous. Heavy trucks lumber by that spot, and
very poor people hurry past, while their children,
half clothed and hungry, scream over their games,
which must be played on the kerb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S. K.,” I said, “I wish it might have been
different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He bought that plot,” S. K. answered,
“when he married Eliza Bowen. You would not
understand, but she had done things that made
good people distrust her. You know, hard as it
may seem, Nat, you usually give yourself the
dose that makes the pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew that, and said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I asked why people, such great people,
should have come to visit a woman who was not
all that she should have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. said they didn’t, and that the tales of
her entertaining were largely fictitious--meaning
made up. He said that during the time the
Bonapartes were in America she was abroad, so
that plainly she did not entertain them; and in
other cases dates prove the same tale. Abroad,
he said, it was different. That broken French
from an American was quaint, while bad English
from an American was common, and made the
speaker so. And he said that some of her little
girl phrases, which were not nice, had clung to
her, and, with what people knew of her here,
spoiled her chances for social success. He said
her own niece, who lived with her, said she never
entertained the Bonapartes, and was much alone.
But--she kept a table with glass and bits of
silver on it, spread, she said, as it had been for
the dinner she gave to Joseph Bonaparte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then S. K. asked me if I’d ever read “Great
Expectations,” and told me of an old woman in
there whose lover had failed to appear at the
wedding, and how she wore her wedding clothes
for years after and let the wedding feast stay on
the table untouched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rodents crawled from the cake,” said S. K.,
“dust lay on all the china, cobwebs hung from
the candlesticks, and--she waited. And I think
Dickens visited America before he wrote this.
Do you suppose he saw Madam Jumel’s table
and got his idea there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I didn’t know, but it interested me a lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, because it was getting late, we had to
start off. I didn’t want to go because I’d had
a good time with S. K. and hated to end it. I
always do have a good time when I’m with him,
and I always hate to have to stop!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XIX</span>--<span class='sc'>Two Surprises</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> week before Christmas was packed tight
with hurry, tired bones, fun, and, for me, a short
worry and two surprises, one of which made my
disquiet. And the week after held indigestion,
more tired bones, more fun, and one surprise.
And they each held a mysterious happening
which no one could explain. The second of
these being so serious that my stories of hearing
things at night were at last taken seriously. Even
the rappings which they had all heard had not
made them see that anything out of the ordinary
was really happening, until the after-Christmas
affair convinced them. Feeling this, I had given
up speaking of what occurred to bother me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was like telling of the huge fish you
<span style='font-size:smaller'>HONESTLY</span> really almost landed, and then having
the listener say: “Oh yes. But I suppose he
got away?” and--smile. It shut you up. It
was that way with my affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Evelyn began to say, “How many
brigands slept on the balcony last night,
Natalie?” or, “I heard strange noises at five
this morning. It <span class='it'>might</span> have been the milkman,
but Natalie seems to think it was a thug who
came in to steal her flashlight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps I would say: “It <span class='it'>was</span> gone!” and
then everyone would laugh, for of course they
thought I had mislaid it; and naturally thought
so, since a real thief is rarely satisfied with one
flashlight costing a dollar and forty cents. Just
as I decided to stop assuring them that something
was happening (it seemed futile to keep
up--they <span class='it'>wouldn’t</span> believe me) Evelyn stopped
teasing me. I think Doctor Vance’s saying I
wasn’t especially well made that. And I was glad
to have it cease. It wasn’t a joke to me!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I said, the week before Christmas was a
hurried time. Aunt, Evelyn, and Amy gave lots
of people presents and I helped them wrap them
up. It was great fun. The red and green
tissues, the beautiful ribbons and the cunning
stickers made things so pretty that you never
thought of the bother. But I will acknowledge
that I tired of the flavour of the stickers, which
was assertive and clung. I believe any stationery
house would make a <span class='it'>fortune</span> if they manufactured
Christmas seals that tasted as nice as they look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said so to S. K. one afternoon a few days
before Christmas. He had come up and we were
in the library. Amy was playing the victrola,
between going to the hall to inspect the packages
which kept arriving so steadily; Evelyn was
writing thank you notes for things she <span class='it'>hadn’t
received</span>! She said she always did, because it
saved the bother after Christmas, when parties
were scheduled for almost every minute; and that
it was quite simple since all you had to do was
to say: “Your beautiful gift means so <span class='it'>much</span>
to me, and I shall always treasure it.” But
Amy told me one year Aunt Penelope mailed
these before Evelyn knew it and a lot of the
thanked people hadn’t come across. Naturally
it was awkward and took a great deal of talented
explaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to go back to that afternoon. S. K.
said: “That’s one thing you haven’t tried--glue.”
And I knew he meant putting it in the
bracelet box. He smiled at me in a teasing
way after that, for even he didn’t take me
seriously then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I answered, “but I will, or something
better for leaving a trail. It’s a good idea.”
I was really taken with it and decided upon red
paint, as I tied up a set of bridge scores that Aunt
Penelope was going to send to a cousin of hers
who lives miles from nowhere on a Western farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I attacked a lot of nut bowls and crackers
that Evelyn had got at a bargain from a gift
shop. Amy tried to crack a peanut with the
crackers, and even its fragile shell was not dented,
but Evelyn explained that “It was <span class='it'>the thought</span>”
that counted. Personally, I decided that the
kind of thoughts one would have on using those
things would count against you--if Heaven’s
Gate Keeper were listening, but I didn’t say so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got sixteen of those last Christmas,” said
S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had planned to give you one!” I gasped,
and I really did it well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” he said, growing quite excited,
“you know I was joking. I should love having
you give me one! I’m simply a stupid fool,
that’s all and----” And then I laughed, and
Evelyn, who had stopped writing to listen, did
too, for she had helped me get my present for
S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, you humbug!” he ordered. I
came. He reached up and pulled me down on
the lounge beside him, very hard. “What’ll I
do to her, Miss Evelyn?” he asked, as he
frowned down on me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn said I was hopeless and that she
thought nothing short of arsenic, and a large
dose of that, would have any effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, we’ll let her live a small while
longer,” he temporized, and I slipped my hand
in his because I am always a little sorry when I
tease him, although it is fun to do. “I’ll tell
you,” he went on. “We’ll have bread and
butter, and that <span style='font-size:smaller'>ONLY</span>, with tea for a
month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I won’t come down and have tea with
you,” I replied, “for I can get that kind of a
hand-out here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, you slangy young thing, I am loved
for my food?” he asked. He looked quizzical,
but I thought he wondered, and of course I told
him I loved him for himself. Evelyn was amused,
which was silly of her, because it was nothing to
be flippant about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I leave the room?” she asked, in an
attempt to be funny. And then, for the first
time, I realized that S. K. was not so much
older than I, after all, and that perhaps he, as
well as other people, might not understand. He
had seemed like Uncle Frank, or Bradly-dear;
like someone who belonged to me, and to whom
I belonged. I had adopted him into the family-side
of my heart because he had been so good
to me, and of course for the same reason I loved
him. But I wondered then, whether my saying
so sounded silly, and it made me grow pink and
look down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But S. K. helped me out as he always does.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered, and I felt that he was
looking at me and in a very kind way, “that is
not the kind of love Nat means. Hers has a
sort of small girl, open-air, baseball flavour that
is attractive, but--not right for a flirtation.
When she learns the other sort, you may leave
the room--and quickly, please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn laughed, and went on scribbling. I
could see that her remark had been idle, and
that she thought S. K.’s was too, but I looked
up. S. K. was looking down at me and I felt
frightened and very happy, and quite hot but a
little chilly; and I began, right then, to know
that I did care a great, great deal for S. K.
and that--he cared for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t need the thing he blurted out in a
whisper, to be sure. For his eyes had said it.
What sounded as if it were shaken from him
was: “My dearest?” and it came as a question,
and after it he bit his lips, grew slowly red and
looked away. I knew he was sorry he had
spoken, and I was sorry too, for it frightened me,
and because I did not know what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I got up and began to wrap up Christmas
things and S. K. did not watch me as he usually
does, but looked into the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you were going to punish her,”
said Evelyn in that level voice which people use
when they’re writing hard or playing the piano
softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Decided it was futile,” he answered; and I
saw that he was upset too, for he spoke stiffly.
And then, after refusing tea and making a light
mention of an engagement, he left. And I went
on wrapping up packages, but my hands shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you see him out?” Evelyn
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied that Ito was in the hall and that I
didn’t see any reason for doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Amy came in and said that Herbert was
coming, and that meant that she and I had to
get out. For ever since that afternoon that I
bumped into him while attempting to walk, he
and Evelyn have been discussing inner draperies
and how to keep cooks, and the right proportion
for a rent, and where to live, for they got engaged
that day. Amy told me about it. She said it
was dramatic and exceedingly interesting, but
that they ordered her off just when she most
wanted to stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed he bolted in the room, and two feet
from Evelyn paused. Amy said he was absolutely
white and spoke in a deep, shaken voice.
She really described it beautifully. He said:
“<span class='it'>You have been ill!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she said: “Oh, <span class='it'>Herbert</span>,” and began to
cry. Then she stretched a hand out to him,
and he put his arms around her and said: “My
<span class='it'>darling!</span>” Amy, who had been sitting in a high-backed
Italian chair, naturally got up to look
over it, and then Evelyn ordered her off. She
whispered: “Please, Amy--go----” and Amy
felt that she had to. But she was annoyed at
Evelyn, for she wasn’t bothering anyone, and
she said it was better than movies or the theatre,
for she knew the principal characters, and she
said that they were acting wonderfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to go back; after I left them that afternoon
I went to my room. Amy had to do some
telephoning and stopped outside of the library
door to do it. She said she liked that telephone
better, but I think she did it because it annoys
Evelyn. Of course the most loving sisters
occasionally positively work to think up ways of
annoying one another; it belongs to them just as
much as does taking each other’s clothes, or
borrowing hats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my room I sat down by the window and I
did not light the lights.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wanted to think
and in the half-light it seemed easier for the sort
of reverie in which I was going to indulge. For,
if you can understand it, I was frightened. I
loved S. K., I knew that; but I didn’t want to
plan a house as Evelyn and Herbert were and to
have people go off to leave us alone to do it.
Sometimes Herbert kisses Evelyn when they are
alone, I am quite sure of it, for I heard Evelyn
say: “Don’t, dear--someone is coming,” as I
came in one day. And Amy assured me that
that was a part of being engaged. I can’t quite
explain, because I am stupid about making words
carry my thoughts, but at that moment I very
much wanted to be back in Queensburg, playing
ball, walking, or riding. I wanted Willy to say,
“Come out and play catch, Nat!” and not to
be worried about things that loomed ahead, things
that I was afraid must come before I was ready
for them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But--curiously, with all that
fear, I had that happy but sad, and lovely but
hurting sensation that neither Bradly-dear nor
Uncle Frank had ever had. I think my mother
would have understood it, and I know she could
have helped me. I tried to shut my eyes and
pretend she could talk to me, but it only left me
a little choked and wanting her fearfully. I
think, perhaps, if she had been there, that I
would have put my head down on her shoulder
and cried--although I never do cry--and that
she would have said, “My dear little girl!
My baby!” which is strange, since I cannot
remember a word of hers and possibly she never
did call me “My dear little girl,” or “My
baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while Amy came rustling in to show me
a new frock, and made a good deal of noise and
turned on all the lights, which helped me. And
then I got dressed for the evening, and we heard
Uncle Archie come in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to take Evelyn’s place with
him,” Amy said piously as she looked at her
back in a cheval glass. “Evelyn has absorbed
<span class='it'>all</span> his attention recently, but I’m going to cut
her out. I think he’s a dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I agreed with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think it looks so sweet to see a father
and daughter devotedly attached,” said Amy.
Again I agreed and loudly, for I thought Uncle
Archie would be pleased by her paying him attention,
as he was by Evelyn’s doing so, and I
knew that Amy had to limelight herself before
she enjoyed doing anything kind. She had to
occupy the centre of the stage. She’s built that
way. That is really the reason she confessed
about the violets, but that comes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were guests at dinner, and Ito spilled
soup, but otherwise it was uneventful. And afterward
Amy went out to a little party to which I
had not been asked, Evelyn went out with Mr.
Apthorpe, aunt and her guests played cards in
the living-room and I went to mine again--to
write letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought writing to Uncle Frank would help
me, but it didn’t. I knew that if I had wanted
advice, he probably would tell me how long a
grasshopper woos its mate before marriage, instead
of talking to me about mine. I love him,
but his soul is steeped in bugs. The person I
wanted to ask help from was S. K., but doing
so seemed odd under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At nine I heard a noise, a funny noise. I got
up and turned off my light and waited. After
a few moments I heard a scrape on the side of the
building and I turned on the electrics suddenly.
At that, something slid down against the outside
wall. I heard it. Whatever it was had
slipped down the side of the house, scraping all
the way. I again turned out the lights and going
to the window peered out. In the dim light of
the court seeing was difficult, but I did manage
to make out a black mass on S. K.’s balcony
and then I heard a window slide up and this
disappeared. And, without picking up a scarf or
a wrap, I hurried out, ran down the balcony until
I reached the fire-escapes, which are in front of
the main hall windows and are always well illuminated
by them. I ran down these, and it
seemed like old times, for the going was not
steady. Of course, the rail was just a rod, the
building was high and the steps steep. I realized
that New York had tamed me, for by the time
I reached S. K.’s window I was glad to stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here I kicked a hole through the window-pane,
knocked out the glass and entered. S. K.’s
man was evidently washing up things, for he
came toward me with a towel and a glass in one
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Panting a little, I told him I’d seen a man go
in the office window. S. K. has a sort of office
in the room that corresponds to mine in his apartment.
Debson immediately put down the glass,
told me to be quiet, settled his shoulders, and
began the hunt. He was brave, but I could see
that he was frightened, for he was white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whispered a direction for me to the library,
and there I went. I tiptoed, quite naturally, and
S. K. was surprised to see me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nat!” he gasped, and then he stopped, for
I gestured for silence, just as hard as I could.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To make a long story short, there was no
one, and I suppose both those men thought I was
crazy, and S. K. had to get a new glass for
that window I kicked in. But he was nice
about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did see someone come in here,” I said
lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear anything, Debson?” S. K.
asked. Debson shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not since Maggie left, at least, sir,” he
qualified. “She went to the balcony to shake
a duster, I think, sir, although I am not sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was probably it,” said S. K. He dismissed
Debson and then said: “Sit down, Nat.”
And I did. Then he told me that he thought it
was fine and brave of me, and that he appreciated
it, although my going without a wrap
worried him, and my Paul Revereing it down a
fire-escape was a dangerous practice for night--or
any other time, for that matter. And I
promised him I wouldn’t do it again, unless there
was a fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then S. K. said: “Nat, can you stay a little
while? I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I could, and he asked me to come over
and sit by him on a wide davenport which stands
before his big fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” he said, “that you know it,
because I didn’t mean to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right,” I answered, although
it wasn’t; I was frightened and unhappy all over
again, and my heart was pumping fearfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered, “it is not all right. It
is all wrong. You are seventeen, and two or
three good-time, free years are ahead of you--must
be ahead of you. I wouldn’t for the world
disturb your peace, make you think of anything
that would turn you older. I love having you
frankly friendly, treating me as a chum. I am
afraid I have spoiled things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said he hadn’t, although he really had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you were disturbed by the way I looked
at you,” he went on; “what I said. I didn’t
mean to, Nat. It shot out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was weak
at that moment, but I promise I won’t be again.
I assure you, you needn’t be worried about it,”
he ended stiffly. “I will never bother you with
it. In fact, now it would be as unsatisfactory
to me as it would be to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a very cool statement for S. K. I
didn’t understand it, and it hurt. And that and
the feeling that perhaps our tight friendship was
gone made me ache. Then I looked at him and
saw that he felt badly too. He smiled as our
eyes met, but not happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had planned this very differently,” he said.
“We were going to be better friends all the time,
you know, and then one day, when you were
several years older and a little tired of a world
that held only parties and fluffy frocks, I would
tell you that I had liked you ever since you were
a school-going youngster, and I liked to dream
that you would find that I had come to mean
something in your heart and that----” And
then S. K. stopped abruptly and said: “Nat,
I shouldn’t be allowed loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Oh yes you should, S. K.!” And
I found the greatest cure for a heartache, and
that is finding someone you love suffering from
the same thing. I immediately quite forgot mine
and thought of S. K.’s. And I did something
then that sounds silly, but which wasn’t, and
didn’t seem so at the time. I moved closer to
S. K. and rested my cheek against his coat-sleeve.
He fumbled for my hand, and when he
found it I squeezed his hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said I was a “ripping little pal,” and his
voice was not awfully steady, and so I think he
really thought so. And in that position, where I
did not have to meet his eyes, and yet where I
was strengthened by his touch--for it did
strengthen me--I told him how I felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S. K. dear,” I whispered, “I want some
more baseball, and not to <span class='it'>have</span> to think of love
and such stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, dear,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I said: “This afternoon I felt as I
did before I did my first really high dive. Wasn’t
that silly? For there’s nothing to be frightened
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a thing, dear,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I told him about wanting my mother,
and the garden, and how it made me feel, and
that I had felt that way when I began to realize
that afternoon how much I cared for him. And
then he sat up suddenly, and I did too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Care?” he echoed. “Oh, my dear child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Of course.” A clock somewhere
struck ten, and I stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re only seventeen,” said S. K., and
somewhat wistfully. I knew why he said it; he
was afraid my feeling for him was what Amy
would call a “case,” but it wasn’t. I knew that
even then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” I agreed, and smiled up at him. He
drew a long breath, started to speak, stopped
quickly, and went to hunt a mandarin coat for
me to wear going upstairs, since the halls were
draughty. He helped me into it, made me go
over and look at myself in a long glass, called me
Miss Tsing, and then said the last word about
what had happened--that is, the last word about
it for a good while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pals again?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I put out my hand, and we shook hard.
“<span class='it'>Truly</span>,” I answered, and then we went upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why couldn’t we drive down Fifth Avenue
to-morrow afternoon?” he asked, as we paused
in our outer hall. “The excitement would be
interesting to look at, with everything at its
height.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought it would be fine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might go in to Mary Elizabeth’s,” he
went on. “I’ll telephone her to beat up some
extra waffle batter; that is, if you think you can
go.” He was teasing me, and it was just like
old times. I didn’t feel at all as I had before I
went down. And it was silly of me to feel that
way, anyway; for he is S. K., and I should
have known that he wouldn’t, or couldn’t, hurt
me. I went to sleep, slept well, and was untroubled
by noises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I got up the next morning Aunt Penelope
said, “Thank Heaven you look as if you
felt well. I’ll need your help. This will be an
awful day; it always is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are so
many things to do that I don’t know <span class='it'>where</span> to
start.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ito, was that the bell? Yes, it
was--what was it?” and then she stopped, and
I looked up and gave a little cry, for Uncle Frank
stood in the doorway, peering over his glasses at
me and blinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho hum----” he said. “Couldn’t keep
away! Couldn’t keep away! Ho hum----” I
didn’t speak. I only hugged him.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XX</span>--<span class='sc'>Christmas Fun</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Aunt Penelope</span> was right--the day before
Christmas was an awful day for hurry. Everyone
simply flew, and almost every six seconds
Amy would come in to tell of someone she’d forgotten
to remember, Ito would appear to say that
someone was wanted by someone at the telephone,
and Evelyn would say: “Another pot of
poinsettias and ferns. Where <span class='it'>shall</span> I tell Jane to
put it?” There were lots of roses too, and they
made the whole place fragrant and beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hall there were millions of packages,
unopened cards on a tray, and messenger boys
waiting for someone to sign their books. I loved
it all, and having Uncle Frank there made it
perfect. He kept wandering around saying “Ho
hum” and hunting his spectacles, which had all
gradually climbed up on his forehead. And he
gave the touch of home that I had needed. It
is curious, but I have found that you never realize
how very much you have missed anyone until you
have them near again and <span class='it'>don’t</span> miss them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lunch was a hurried affair, but at this meal
Aunt Penelope became coherent long enough to
suggest that I ask Mr. Kempwood up for the
celebration and opening of presents, which was
to be at eight o’clock, after an early dinner. I
said I would love to, and I immediately telephoned
him about it, and asked if he would take
Uncle Frank that afternoon too. He said he
would be charmed to do so, and at five we started
for a drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going was great fun, for there was so much
excitement. All the shop windows were blazing,
and people seemed happy. They always do at
Christmas-time; I think even mean spirits warm
up and stop refrigerating anything they touch
after December twenty-third. But, unfortunately,
they begin being mean again about
January third or fourth. I have always had the
feeling that perhaps the Christmas bills made
their pessimism return, for bills are depressing
to even a constitutionally happy individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to get on, we had tea, and I made mine
a little heavy, because I really hadn’t had much
lunch, and altogether enjoyed myself. Uncle
Frank and S. K. got along beautifully and did
most of the talking. Because I was hungry, I
occupied myself with eating and listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless that young person will take you
to the Jumel Mansion,” said S. K., with a nod
toward me and a smile for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Frank nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Audubon lived near here,” he said after he
stood up and slipped out of his coat. “Wonderful
man, ho hum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed S. K., and then slowly smiled,
and as if he couldn’t help it. I do too, for Uncle
Frank had a string of tinsel tied around his collar
and under his chin in a great bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pulled it off and showed it to him, and he
explained. He had been helping Evelyn and
Herbert trim the tree before we started out, and
Amy had given him that four-in-hand. Then he
put his hand in his pocket and brought out a bit
of a broken glass ball, and then, very carefully,
the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest,” I said, “you will cut yourself!”
But he didn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must have slipped it in there, thinking it
was my handkerchief,” he explained, “then
hung my handkerchief on the tree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. said it was easy to do those things, and
then he smiled at me, and I answered it, for I
could see that he liked Uncle Frank and understood
him. After we finished eating, S. K.
bought me a tiny Santa Claus about an inch long
and pinned it on my lapel, and I bought him
one and pinned it on his, and Uncle Frank stood
looking on and blinking. Then we pushed
through the crowd and started on. And being
out was gorgeous. I hated going in, but of
course we had to, for dinner was to be served
very promptly at seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attitude of suspense in the apartment was
thrilling. The curtains that frame the living-room
doors were drawn across them, and from
behind them someone was tacking something up.
Greens trailed over pictures, and holly bloomed
in jardinières. Corners were lit by all sorts of
flowers, and the air smelled like a hothouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope, looking very tired, but happy,
met me and told me to make haste about dressing,
and I went toward my room. Here, I prepared
to bathe, first getting out all the prettiest things
I owned and laying them on the bed, for I did
want to look very gay. I decided on my pink
dress, for it is the most beautiful one I have,
and because I thought it would look nice with a
bouquet of tiny roses which I found waiting me
on my return. S. K. had sent them and they
were dear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I began to slip from my clothes, and as
I unclasped my bracelet I decided I had been
silly about the whole affair and that I probably
imagined a good deal of it. For nothing but the
noise against the wall and the black form on
S. K.’s balcony had occurred to disquiet me
during that last week. I opened the drawer to
put the bracelet away while I bathed, for I am
careful of where I leave it, and when I opened its
box I found a note. This was written on brown
butcher’s paper, and it was a little hard to make
out. It said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Natalie Page is ordered to leave her bracelet
under a stone which lies beneath the first
bush to the right of the side entrance of the
Jumel Mansion. This must be done at five
o’clock on December 28 without fail. If she
comes alone and tells no one, no harm will come
to her, but if she speaks of this misfortune will
follow quickly and in the worst form. All will
be well if instructions are absolutely obeyed, and
if not, great suffering and unhappiness are bound
to occur. Be wise! Take warning!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After I read it I put it down. Then I read it
again, as I sat on the edge of my bed (my knees
shook), and then I wondered how the person who
warned me had got it in my bracelet box without
anyone’s knowing it? and then--I stood up,
clasped the bracelet on, because I thought my
arm was the safest place to leave it, and went to
get my bath. I hurried because aunt doesn’t like
people’s being late. I decided I would forget
the affair for this one evening, if I could. And--begin
to consider what I would do the next
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I was dressed, and I will acknowledge
I looked as nice as I can, I hurried toward the
hall, where I found S. K. (aunt had asked him
to come up to dinner), Amy, who was fox-trotting
with Herbert, Evelyn, who was sorting packages,
and uncle, who was helping her take them to the
living-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat down on a long chest which came from
Holland and is beautifully carved, and S. K.
sat down beside me. I told him I loved the baby
roses, and he said that I looked very nice.
Then he said he wished he could fox-trot with
me, and I told him I liked sitting out with him
better. I am very sorry that he feels badly
about being lame. I think that if people who
have deformities would realize that people like the
deformities because of <span class='it'>them</span>, they would get on
better. Just the sight of S. K.’s cane always
makes me feel well, because it belongs to him.
Awkwardly, I told him this, and he said I had
made him a Christmas present of a new viewpoint
which he liked and which would help him. Then
he looked at me carefully and said: “Small girl,
what’s worrying you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied that nothing was; he called me a
cheerful prevaricator, and then Ito announced
dinner, and we went in. It was positively the
nicest meal I ever ate in Uncle Archie’s dining-room,
and the food had nothing to do with its
seeming so, but the little Santas which stood at
each place and the verses on the place-cards and
the laughter and talk did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we got up. Uncle Archie disappeared to
light the candles on the tree; we were signalled
and filed in. It was a pretty tree, and opening
things was the greatest fun, and we had jokes
among the gifts too. Everyone gave Uncle Frank
worsted spiders, papier-mâché bugs, or crêpe
paper butterflies. Evelyn had got a doll’s coat
for Amy made of fur, and they gave me a toy
pistol and a trap. Uncle Archie’s joke was a
bottle of “Seven Sutherland Sisters” hair tonic
and a switch, because he has hardly any hair.
There were lots of others too, and a great many
beautiful things. Quite everyone talked at once,
paper rustled and grew to great heaps on the
floor, ribbons tangled around your ankles as you
stepped, and it was--just the way Christmas
always is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had some lovely things given me. Aunt gave
me a tiny string of corals because I am dark and
she thought they would look well on me, and
Uncle Archie a book that he had selected himself,
which made me very happy. Evelyn and Amy
gave me charming things to wear--handkerchiefs,
silk underthings, and so on--and Uncle Frank a
book on the development of bills in the wild fowl
of South Africa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very interesting subject,” he said, peering
at me over his glasses (one pair was actually on
his nose!). “Plate seventy-two--ho hum--let
me see it.” I passed it to him, and he went off
in a corner near the victrola and read it all the
evening. Amy ran that all the time and with a
loud needle. I think it bothered Uncle Frank,
although he didn’t seem to realize it, but every
once and again he would shake his head, as you
do when you get water in your ears while
swimming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. grinned at this a good deal, and very
tenderly at me. “You little peach!” he said,
and I loved it, although I had to protest that I
did enjoy having that book and that it would
mean a lot to me. S. K. had heard me thank
uncle, and I had been extremely exuberant, because
Amy had drawn near, looked at it, and
said, “Oh----” in a kind of an “Is-<span class='it'>that</span>-all”
manner, and I was afraid Uncle Frank might be
hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you liked it,” said S. K.; “you
would, Nat, I swear----” But he stopped, and
I don’t know what he was going to swear. He
only shook his head, covered my hand with his,
and squeezed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right for a pal to tell you he likes
you, isn’t it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said it was and that he’d better, then aunt
brought up a tiny package, and it was marked
from S. K., and I was surprised, for I had supposed
the tiny roses were my present from him.
I explained this as I unwrapped it, and when I
did--well, I couldn’t speak; I just held it and
looked until tears made things waver, and then I
began to do my champion quick-swallowing
trick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone stood around and asked to look at
it, and I let them, but I didn’t let go of it, and
Aunt Penelope frankly wiped her eyes. “Just
like her, dear,” she said, “and your good friend
‘S. K.’ had it painted from a tiny photograph
I had. Come here, Frank, and see this miniature
of Nelly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Kempwood had it made for
Natalie.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s on ivory and is simply exquisite.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Then aunt turned to me and
said: “You haven’t thanked him, dear.” She
did it very gently, for I think she saw how greatly
I cared for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she has!” said S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I hadn’t, and I didn’t know how ever to
do it. Something--I suppose a very full heart--made
me turn to S. K., slip my arm around his
neck, pull his face down, and kiss him. “I
hope,” I said, “that you won’t mind, for that
is the only way I know how to show you. I
<span class='it'>can’t</span> say it.” And then I asked aunt if that was
all right, and she said it was, and blew her nose
and cried a little more, and Evelyn put her arm
around me, and I allowed Uncle Frank to take
possession of the miniature, and he stood holding
that in one hand and my book on duck bills in
the other, and--blinking awfully hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Amy loudly, “this <span class='it'>won’t</span> do;
everyone is threatening weeps! And--it’s
Christmas Eve!” So I put the miniature on
the middle of a big table in its little case, and
joined whatever went on. But I went back to
the table very often to look at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy was right about it; everyone had been
upset, even S. K., which was queer, for he
didn’t know my mother. But when I looked at
him, after I’d thanked him, I saw that his eyes,
too, were full of tears. And he didn’t talk very
much for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was so kind to me that I knew he knew
I was grateful, even if I couldn’t say so properly,
and that my lack of words was not what was
making him quiet.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XXI</span>--<span class='sc'>S. K. forces My Confidence</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a lovely Christmas Eve, and a lovely
Christmas. Everyone was so happy that it
seemed like a new family. Even Uncle Archie
talked! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The day after Christmas, S. K.
made me tell him about the letter. I never knew
he could be so firm, and for the first and last
time I felt the difference in our ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something is worrying you,” he said, “and
if you don’t tell me I shall go to your aunt and
tell her to investigate. And if I know that lady,
she can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S. K.,” I begged, “<span class='it'>please</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was not softened. “Come on, Nat.
No foolishness,” he said, and almost sternly.
“Something worrying you about the bracelet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded, and then, somehow, the story came
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave him the letter, the little bit of cloth
that had been left on my window-sill, and the
notes that were signed E. J. He felt badly that
I had borne it alone and called himself all sorts
of names for taking it so lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear child,” he said, “why didn’t you show
me these things before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said I was foolish, that there were no
such things as ghosts,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There aren’t. Someone’s playing a joke on
you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it will stop. I will see that it
is stopped, and the person shall be punished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him his chin stuck out two inches farther
when he was fierce, but he didn’t laugh at my
joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you weren’t imagining when you told
me that someone had felt for your bracelet when
you fell from your horse on Riverside Drive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “Of course not,” and quite indignantly.
Then I began to see that they had all thought I
was hysterical and silly and made up these tales
from the creakings of floors and lost flashlights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t told them anything recently,” I
said, “because they laughed. But the trap did
catch someone, S. K. I did not mislay it afterward;
I heard it snap, and that was the night
this piece of cloth was torn from his or her
clothes. And sometimes the bracelet comes
back. It slides in----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell them, here?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said it had annoyed aunt and that she had
asked me not to think of it, since it was clearly
impossible and a half-dream of mine, and not to
mention it to Amy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you didn’t believe me either,” I said.
“Not that I blame you; it did sound crazy, but
there simply wasn’t anyone to tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never forgive myself for this,” he said,
“never.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That I should fail you----”
Then he shook his shoulders, frowned, and went
on with: “There must be some explanation, and
we will have it. That bracelet walking in by
itself is clearly impossible, and its leaving the
same way too----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the ghost that Mademoiselle Nitschke
heard?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” he said, “there were three
quarrelling families under one roof. Don’t you
think it natural that one, if he could disturb the
other, would try to do so? Why Will Chase,
or the other one, could have thought of a
thousand ways to make rappings and so frighten
the Pérys out of their wits. And if he or the
other one--frightened them so that they would
leave the old place, so much to the good. One
less family to disagree with, more room. Can’t
you see it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We’ll say that one of the
Chase men went out at twelve and threw a ball
against the wall of the Pérys’ room, then say he
crept inside, took a heavy cane on which he tied
a pad, so that the ceiling wouldn’t be marred,
stepped up on a chair, and whanged that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Then--Mr. Péry leaps from his chair in fright.
Mr. Chase goes on pounding as a smile gradually
widens on his face; someone above speaks, the
Chase individual can hear the voice since the
doors are open, and, although it was a mansion
for that day, it is not a great house for to-day.
The sounds easily carry, and especially since it
is night and a ‘calm September one, in which
hardly a leaf stirred.’ He pounds three times,
and up above three quaking people think a question
is answered and that a ghost walks and
thumps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, there would be countless
ways for him to make noises that would frighten
the Pérys into hysteria, and as for Madam Jumel
clothed in white coming to anyone’s bedside--well,
anyone can wear a long white robe, and
faces cannot be seen in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that that was it?” I asked, a
good deal relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do, Nat,” he replied. “Usually
things of that sort have the most simple explanations.
And this matter must have too. Now
to-night you are going to bring that bracelet
down to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Oh <span class='it'>no!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or let me take it now,” he went on. “I
have a wall safe, you know, and I imagine it
won’t be bothered there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I protested for several minutes, but at length
I had to give in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bring it down to you later,” I temporized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honestly?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “Honestly,” and I meant to, since
S. K. wanted me to. Then, because he had
come in for only a second after the matinée (Amy,
Uncle Frank, and I had gone with him and had
a beautiful time), he went, and we sat down
before the living-room fire and talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At six the bell rang and Ito admitted that man
to whom I had talked on the diner. He made
a great deal of noise in the hall, and I heard him
tell Ito that the “little lady” had told him to
look her up. And then he asked Ito if I wasn’t
“some looker” and added that the apartment
was “a spiffy roost,” and I began to worry,
because I knew aunt would not like him. I didn’t
know what to do. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings,
and I didn’t want to annoy her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ito showed him in, and he settled before the
fire. He talked a great deal and in a carrying
tone, while Amy put her chin higher and higher
in the air, and uncle looked over his glasses.
Then aunt came in, talked to Mr. Bilkins, for
such was his name, and told him that she was
sorry I must be excused, but that I was going
out, and so--she stood up after that, and he
did too, and then Ito took possession of him and
he was shunted out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt sorry for him, sorry for myself; and for
Aunt Penelope, for she felt that I had disgraced
her. I knew that her standards were wrong when
she thought that loud voices and too much slang
made a person “impossible”--that is, that they
would be wrong, if the person’s spirit was splendid
and only the trimmings were off--but I did
not know about this man’s spirit. I only knew
that I had asked him to my aunt’s house before
I knew much about the world’s ways of doing
things, and that it was not wise or sensible to
do. I said I was very sorry, but she couldn’t
get over it, and Ito had to bring her smelling-salts,
and a fan, although the room was not over
warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some toney joint,” she kept muttering
between sniffs of her salts, which was a quotation
from Mr. Bilkins. Then she asked me never,
never, never to do such a thing again, and I
said I wouldn’t. After which I went to my
room, for the atmosphere was not congenial. I
noticed Uncle Frank as I left the room. He was
deep in that book he had given me, and I envied
him, and I wished I could forget myself through
bugs, or anything. Someone--I don’t know
who--said, “Collect something, it doesn’t matter
what,” and I think that someone was thinking of
the forgetting possibilities which come through
a hobby. For the happiest person has moments
when he needs something to make him forget
unhappiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my room I considered the bracelet affair
and decided I <span style='font-size:smaller'>COULD NOT</span> risk S. K.’s being
hurt. For, when aunt and the rest are put out
with me, I realize how much I depend on him.
I wondered what I would do if he were hurt, or
killed; whom I would turn to if I had done something
impossible and needed cheering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I studied it a long time, and then I went down
to S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My soul!” he said, “what a long face the
bracelet leads us to wear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, S. K.,” I answered, “I don’t want to
give it to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he said: “What nonsense! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
Just at that moment his man told him that someone
wanted to speak with him at the telephone;
he excused himself, and I had a chance to think.
It did not seem to me that I <span class='it'>could</span> let him run
that risk. I opened the case, looked down at
the bracelet, and considered it. Then I heard
S. K. coming back, quickly moved, snapped the
case shut, tied it with the ribbon, and said:
“Here.” My voice was not usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she thinks I am going to be killed, does
she?” asked S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t,” I begged, and then I stood up, for
it was getting late, and I was still in day things,
and Amy and I were to go to see a friend after
dinner. I saw him put it in his wall safe, shook
hands, asked him please not to bother to come
up with me, and ran off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found Amy using my dressing-table because
it has a better light than hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother is frightfully shocked,” she said.
“I think that man upset her fearfully, Natalie.
I think it was the <span class='it'>strangest</span> thing for you to
do----” Her voice trailed off and she turned
to see how her hair looked at the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know at that time,” I began, but
she cut me short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wonders how many more people you
talked to,” she went on, “and she <span class='it'>hopes</span> that
this Mr. Stilkins, or whatever his name was, isn’t
a sample of them all. How did you start it,
anyway? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew that cooks did that sort
of thing, but I never knew how they began
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw that she was feeling disagreeable, and
attributed it to too much candy, but this reasoning
did not diminish my wish to thump her. This
was strong. But--I tried to hold my temper
and explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t bother,” she said right in the middle
of my words. “I’m not really interested.” And
then she began to hum and, doing this, left the
room. I did hate her. I think that is the meanest
feminine trick of all, that humming after you’ve
made the other person mad. If I had my way
I’d make that a criminal offence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I slammed things a little after she left, which
is my way of showing temper, and then I forgot
it all, for Uncle Frank asked if he might come
in. He wanted to read aloud a few pages about
how the aigrette makes her nest and takes care
of her young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he finished he said: “And every time a
woman wears them she leaves a mother bird dead
and little ones starving. Ho hum--don’t--think--it’s--worth
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I didn’t either. I never had, and I have
wondered how women could, but I think perhaps
it is because they don’t imagine. A great many
troubles are made that way, simply because someone
fails to realize how the other person (or
aigrette) will feel from something that they themselves
say (or wear).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy was bad tempered all evening. She
called me her “country cousin” in public, which
wasn’t polite, and told how I had got tangled
up in the silver at first. She brought it in nicely,
and people laughed, but I did not think it was
kind. Then she sulked all the way going home,
and only spoke when we were a block from the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people like admiration and <span class='it'>work</span> for
it,” she said. “I, myself, don’t.” And then
I realized that it was not too much candy, but
jealousy, and that even the calling of this man
who did not attract me had impressed Amy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care for it,” I answered shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no!” she agreed, and too loudly. “I
<span class='it'>realize</span> you don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave up and resorted to silence. No one
can do anything with Amy when she feels that
way. And we parted with cool good-nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning something happened that
was funny. Another person came to ask for me.
Amy heard Ito admit him and told Ito to let him
wait in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So many <span class='it'>strange</span> people coming, Ito,” she
said loudly (I heard this afterward); “I think it
would be wisest to let him wait in the hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I was called and I faced--Willy
Jepson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Nat,” he said loudly. “I’m going
to Columbia, starting this term. Wouldn’t let
your uncle tell you. How are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I was well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking it,” he asserted, and I could
see that he was impressed with my clothes. Then
we went into the library, and I could see that
Amy liked Willy’s looks, but evidently he did not
like hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you met before?” I asked, for Amy
was smiling so widely that I thought they had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered Willy, “your cousin told
the Jap to let me wait in the hall--and so I heard
her voice, but we have not met.” Willy was
insulted by that. He told me so afterward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nat,” he said, “all the instincts of a
Southern gentleman were outraged in me by that
order. I, the son of Colonel Jepson of Queensburg,
Virginia, am not <span class='it'>used</span> to waiting in halls!”
Willy has quite a little dignity when he wants to
use it, and, like all Southern men, puts out his
chest a tiny bit when he speaks of the fact that
he <span class='it'>is</span> a Southerner. To be just, Amy did not
understand how frightful he thought it was, but
in our town anyone but a nigger is asked in, and
warmly welcomed. Even Mr. Bilkins would have
stopped for supper with anyone of our first
families. We are built that way and the North
is not, that is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amy smiled at Willy and asked him to come
over and sit with her beside the fire. He complied
rather stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard of you,” she said. “Natalie has
told me so many things about how you two played
around together----” And that seemed funny,
because she never would listen when I started,
but I didn’t correct her. Willy said: “Indeed,
Miss James?” But you could tell it was just
something to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the bell rang, and Ito appeared, to give
me a message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kempwood, it seemed, asked if I would
come down immediately? The matter was
urgent. I excused myself and, wondering,
hurried to S. K.’s rooms. I thought it was
strange that he hadn’t gone to business, strange
that he had sent for me instead of coming up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He himself admitted me, and his face was
worried. He did not smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nat,” he said, “I have bad news. The
bracelet is gone. Come in. This is the way
that things were found this morning----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I followed him and looked. The door of the
wall safe was open, and papers were strewn across
the floor. Near a window was the box of
yellowed satin, which had always held my bracelet.
This was wide open, the lid torn from the
back, and empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could hardly speak, but I clutched S. K.’s
arm and whispered: “You were not hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear, but----” he answered. I
could see that the bracelet loss bothered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” I said, “I want to talk.” He
did, and I settled too. “S. K.,” I began, “I
want to tell you something. I know where that
bracelet is----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned forward, and I told him.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XXII</span>--<span class='sc'>Detective Work</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was on my arm. When I rolled up my sleeve,
S. K. gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give up,” he said. “There <span class='it'>is</span> something
supernatural about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I replied, trying to quote from him,
“there is always some logical and sane explanation
of things of this sort. You see, I put it
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “You little devil!” and then he
smiled unwillingly. “Think you’re funny, don’t
you?” he continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I hoped so, for I was trying to be, and
then I told him why I had deceived him; about
Mr. Bilkins, and how, if he were not around,
there would be no one to smooth things if they
were rough. And I added that I couldn’t possibly
spare him, that anxiety would have kept me
awake all that night, and that I was sorry I
fibbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re forgiven,” he answered. “I like
the story--especially the last part.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But--what
gets me is the fact that I put off seeing a
detective until this morning, when last night
might have got the chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S. K.,” I said loudly, “I beg you not to
get one, because that note said that if I told I’d
be hurt. If you have the slightest regard for my
feelings, you will do nothing, and let events care
for themselves. In fact, I forbid your doing so,
and it is, after all, my matter.” I ended this
coolly and as if I meant it. Then I stood up,
rubbed my hand across my forehead, and said:
“I’ve got to get out in the fresh air. Can’t we
motor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said we could, and he was very baffled and
upset by my manner, which was not natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re upset by this,” he said, as he
buttoned my coat for me, “and I simply won’t
have it. You shan’t be made nervous and jumpy,
and I----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not do anything I ask you <span class='it'>not</span> to,
I presume?” I questioned, turning to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Nat----” he protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S. K.,” I said, “if you do, it will end our
friendship--that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, “Well, I’ll be <span class='it'>darned!</span>” and followed
me out. S. K.’s man was in the hall dusting
some old brasses that S. K. had picked up in
the little hill towns of Italy, and I was not surprised.
S. K. was annoyed, for he likes the
work of his establishment to go on when no one
is around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the outer hall I paused. I said I wanted a
drink, and we went in again. Debson wasn’t in
the hall, and I wouldn’t let S. K. ring. “I’ll
go to the kitchen----” I said, and, as he protested,
I ran out. Ito was there, talking to
Debson. I was not surprised at that either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went back, and we went driving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean to speak that way, but I had
to,” I explained after we started. “You see,
your man was listening. I found Ito in the
kitchen, and both Debson and Ito wear duds that
come from Rogers Peet, and last week I went in
there and matched the sample, and it came from
one of their suits.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was quite easy to
match, for it has a purple cast and the weave
is unusually tight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ito!” said S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” I replied, “but I don’t believe
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You engaged this man just after I was
so annoyed and troubled by being followed, and
when I saw the blind man so often. That ceased,
and someone began to creep in my room--get in
somehow--at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will never forgive myself----” said S. K.,
through set teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry; it’s over,” I answered. “All
we have to do now is to arrange to bag him or
them, and that ought to be simple. If I go in
with you, when we return, and tell you where I
am going to hide it to-night, we’ll catch him,
she, or them; I know it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. thought it was a good idea, but we
stopped to see a man who is noted for solving
crimes and finding who did them. In his office
we made all plans, and then we started on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better have lunch with me,” said S. K.,
and then, for the first time, I remembered Willy.
S. K. was not pleased to hear that he had
come. He acted quite peevish, and I was
surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why does he come here?” he asked.
“Lots of good Southern colleges. All you people
are always talking about the supremacy of the
South, and then you lope off and leave it----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I hadn’t----” I put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” he said sharply, “is quite different.
Don’t be silly, Nat.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How old is this young
pup?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose very handsome?” he questioned
further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I admitted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And has already asked you to marry him?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Should be <span class='it'>locked up</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Like to <span class='it'>thrash</span>
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, S. K.,” I protested. “I don’t think
you’re nice. I’m very fond of Willy!” And for
two blocks we didn’t say a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see,” he explained after that long
silence, “that no man has any right to bother a
youngster, or ask her to marry him, no matter
how much he wants to, until she’s past the doll’s
stage? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here you are, having tea in the
nursery, and he butts in where angels would bare
their heads, and says you can ‘<span class='it'>have</span> him,’ if
I recollect correctly. ‘Have him!’ My
heavens!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was mad. I have not played dolls for
years, and I never had tea in the nursery, because
we hadn’t any; I always ate with Uncle
Frank. I maintained a frigid silence. And then
I made talk, deliberately manufactured the
article on coldly impersonal lines, while S. K.
glared ahead and answered in monosyllables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that there is a tablet on the wall
of one of the buildings of Columbia, which asserts
that the Battle of Harlem Heights was enacted
on that spot,” I said. “I’d like to see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt,” said S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I didn’t know what he meant by that, but he
meant something, for his tone was full of implications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps Willy will take me down,” I
went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” said S. K. dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He admires Hamilton,” I continued, “and I
must take him to the Metropolitan to see that
portrait that was painted by Trumbull. What
made Burr challenge Hamilton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Political jealousy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really?” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um,” grunted S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What year did Burr kill Alexander
Hamilton?” I questioned further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“1804.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” I exclaimed, “that was the year the
Jumels were married. Wasn’t that strange--I
mean, considering that she married Aaron Burr
later?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a terrible thing for Burr to do, wasn’t
it?” I said, and then I added that I was glad
duelling had gone out of style and wasn’t allowed
any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If some of to-day’s politicians would shoot
each other,” said S. K., “it would be a great
thing for the country, and I don’t see how they
<span class='it'>could</span> hit the wrong man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the longest speech he made all the
way home. Something had made him very cross
and pessimistic. I gave up trying to make talk
and absorbed and made use of the prevailing
silence. That worried S. K., who, I think,
didn’t want to share the silence that he was
using for an umbrella to cover his grouch. He
looked at me several times as we whirled upstairs,
but I pretended I was completely absorbed in the
little iron plack that says the elevator is inspected
by inspectors every two weeks. But of course
I was not deeply interested in it, having almost
learned it by heart when riding in the elevator
with people at whom I didn’t want to stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In S. K.’s apartment we began to disagree
about getting a detective once more, for that
was the plan. S. K. really did it well. He
walked up and down, using his cane very heavily,
and once and again almost thumping with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I tell you, Nat,” he shouted, “this has
<span class='it'>got</span> to be stopped!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it go a day or so, S. K.,” I pleaded.
“I ask only that--and then, if things don’t calm,
you may do as you like.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But--because
of that note I <span class='it'>beg</span> that you let it go for a couple
of days, anyway. <span class='it'>Please</span>, S. K.!” I entreated,
and really I made my voice shake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After ten minutes of my nervous insistence he
gave in. Then he sat down on the arm of a
chair which faced me, and said: “Where are
you going to put it to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” I answered. “But I’ll hide
it somewhere. There are plenty of places, and
I’m not afraid. I thought perhaps I’d slip out
the bottom drawer of the tall high-boy and put
it on the floor, under that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um,” mused S. K. “Not bad. No one
would think of looking there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought not,” I agreed complacently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he rang for Debson, and he came in and
told us what he had heard in the night. And he
did it well. I wondered whether I was all wrong,
as I looked at him and heard his explanations.
Then I thought of Jane’s confusion and the extreme
doubt about anyone’s icing beer. The
whole thing was confusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, I went off. I asked S. K. not to
bother to come up with me, and I did it coldly,
for he had been unpleasant. But he came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the matter?” I asked, as we
waited for the door to open. He didn’t fence.
He is always honest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been fiendishly cross, haven’t I?” he
questioned, instead of answering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not fiendishly cross,” I said, “but sulky.”
And I went on to say that I cared too much for
him to ever purposely hurt him, and that if I had
I was sorry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you forgive me, Nat?” he asked
stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing to forgive,” I said, “but
I hate having you not like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not <span class='it'>like</span> you?” he echoed. “Not <span class='it'>like</span>
you!” And then he laughed, but not very
happily. But I didn’t know what had troubled
him until later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I got in I found that Willy had gone
and Amy was telling Aunt Penelope how nice he
was. Evelyn was a little amused at Amy’s
description, but that didn’t bother Amy. She
raved on in the most elaborate way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must have been a <span class='it'>dear</span> little boy,” she
said sentimentally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wasn’t,” I responded truthfully. “He
always had three teeth out and his pockets full
of frogs’ legs and garter snakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn shuddered, but Amy chose to dress this
with romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How <span class='it'>brave</span>,” she said, “how manly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went to the door, closed it, asked them
to be quiet and not to let out any surprised exclamations.
After which I told them what had
happened and what was to happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope had been gluing numbers on
records, and had kept a firm clutch on one of
these. “Be calm, girls,” she warned, as
I finished; “we must be calm!” And then
she tried to blow her nose on the record and fan
herself with the handkerchief which she held in
her other hand. Amy kept looking back of her
as if she expected someone to steal up and thump
her at any moment, and Evelyn tried to darn
the darning-egg, while the stocking which should
have been over it lay at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the plan?” said Aunt Penelope, as she
carefully put the paste-brush in the ink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The plan,” I said, “is to be worked out
this evening. Two gentlemen, Mr. Grange and
Mr. Thompson (business friends of Uncle Archie,
for Ito’s benefit), are coming up to play cards.
We will play in here--until something happens;
an absorbing game will keep anyone up, you
know, and I am to stuff a bolster for my bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, isn’t this <span class='it'>thrilling</span>?” said Amy. “And
to think that all this has been going on and no
one knew it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>What was that?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darning-egg,” responded Evelyn with a
glare toward Amy, “and if you can tell me why
you have to shout and scare everyone out of
their senses when anything drops---- Mother,
do you realize that you are putting ‘The New
Republic’ among the Galli Curci records? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I see you have it neatly numbered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have,” said Aunt Penelope, “but be
calm, Evelyn, be calm. We must all be calm!
Here, dear,” and she handed Evelyn an incense-burner,
under the impression that it was her
darning-egg. They were excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I warned them about showing disquiet,
after which I opened the door. Ito was on his
knees, picking up rose petals from the floor.
The table on which the vase of them had stood
was by the library door. I wondered. Anything
like that made speculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here, Ito?” asked aunt.
He opened his hand and showed her the result
of his labours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure!” she said, looking nervously
behind her, and then, lunch being on, we went
out and pretended to eat. Amy said she had
asked Willy to come back that evening. I was
glad, for Uncle Frank was to go at seven something,
and Willy, as a piece of home, would help
over his leaving and the coming strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herbert will be here,” said Evelyn when Ito
was in the kitchen and we were alone. Then
she looked at the centre-piece with a sort of
moony expression that made her look half-witted.
You could see that it was true love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He always is,” said Amy. Then she spilled
salt and had about ten thousand spasms. “Bad
luck,” she said. “Oh, <span class='it'>dear</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A nonsensical superstition!” said Aunt
Penelope sharply, “but throw it over your
shoulder. Amy, <span class='it'>if you kick the table again you
may go to your room</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the telephone rang, and aunt pretended
it was Uncle Archie. “Your father says some
friends of his are coming up to play cards,” she
announced as she returned. “He suggested that
we ask Mr. Kempwood to make a fourth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” Evelyn asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After dinner,” replied Aunt Penelope, as she
settled. Ito had heard, and after he left the
room we heard voices from the kitchen. The
door swung; I heard Jane’s voice very clearly,
and it said: “To-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow we got through the afternoon, but
not happily. Everyone jerked and jumped and
said, “<span class='it'>Did you hear that?</span> What <span class='it'>was</span> it?” if a
hair as much as stirred. Amy said she would feel
much better when Willy came in, and Evelyn
said: “I <span class='it'>wish</span> Herbert would hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I dressed at seven, and after I’d got along to
the hair-doing stage, ran up my shade and my
window a little way, as if I felt that the room
was close. Then, after looking around, I put
my bracelet under the bottom drawer of the tall
high-boy. And after I did so I heard the tiniest
noise on the balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I slipped from my kimono, put on my
frock, hooked it, closed my window, and left.
Dinner was a very exciting affair, but it didn’t
compare with the developments of the later evening.
Those--oh, my! Again I need that word
that hasn’t yet been made--the one that means
fear in all its various forms. Everyone was
frightened, even the detectives; I know it.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XXIII</span>--<span class='sc'>Waiting for the Human Mouse</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>After</span> dinner I sat down to read, Amy and Willy
played double Canfield, Evelyn and Herbert went
off to the little drawing-room to talk about their
house, Aunt Penelope ran the victrola, and Uncle
Archie, S. K., and our two guests played auction.
They put up quite a heavy stake on it, criticized
each other’s plays after each hand, and acted as
people do when they are playing cards for
pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ito came in with a tray of glasses and some
sort of light Italian wine, and then he left, and it
began to get late. Of course, Willy didn’t know
about it, and at ten he left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went with him to the hall, and he told me
how insulted he had been by Amy that morning,
but that he felt that there were possibilities in
her and that he was going to try to develop them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he coughed and said: “You know that
offer of mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I recalled it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he went on, “it is good. No
Southern gentleman ever forgets his honour, but
we were both young. You know darned well,
Nat, that I’ll go through with it if I <span class='it'>have</span> to,
but I think you’d be a better pitcher than a
wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody had annoyed me that day, Uncle
Frank had just left, and saying good-bye to him
was hard, and I was excited over the mystery,
so I spoke frankly, to be truthful. I almost
shouted, “I wouldn’t <span class='it'>have</span> you!” and then I
turned and saw S. K. coming towards us. He
was going down to get a piece of Japanese carving
that aunt wanted to see, but he let Willy
start before he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “thank Heaven I did! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Nat, I’m a fool, but that chap’s coming upset
me. You see, my conscience keeps me from
entering the race just now. His evidently does
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I explained and put him right on that. “And
anyway,” I added, “there wouldn’t be any
race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear child,” he said, “if I dared let myself
believe you! But,” he continued, with a change
in tone, “that is a tabooed subject. Some day,
if it is true, you’ll prove it. Now, won’t you?”
He looked down at me ever so anxiously, and I
laughed up at him. I felt exceedingly light-hearted
since the weight of his disapproval was
removed. That had really bothered me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The subject,” I said, “is tabooed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his hands on my shoulders, shook me
gently, told me I was a “dear scamp,” and
started off. The minute after he got outside the
lights went out, and I never in all my life have
heard anything like the noise that followed!
Evelyn and Herbert rushed out of the little drawing-room
and fell over a pedestal. Amy fell over
a chair that had a pile of records on it, and those
tipped off and clattered as they went to pieces
on the bare floor. Someone knocked over the
card-table, and someone else the chair that held
the tray of glasses; Aunt Penelope screamed,
and Uncle Archie said things that I cannot quote,
repeating them at intervals, in this manner:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the blank do you think you’re doing!”
or, “Penelope, shut up that blank noise!” He
became frightfully natural, as people do in crises,
and added considerably to the confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the lights came on again the detectives
looked very silly. One of them said something
about hoping “it” would never get out. Then
Ito was summoned and asked what had happened
to the lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not can say,” he replied, with a lift of his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went to my room, looked for my bracelet,
and found it was gone. Everything moved
after that. Ito, Jane, and the cook were ordered
to the library, where for the first and last time
they sat in state; S. K. and his man were sent
for, and enough moves to satisfy even Douglas
Fairbanks were packed into the next few
minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was this fellow doing when you went
down?” the detective asked of S. K. He looked
at Debson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” S. K. answered. “I didn’t
go down. I heard the noise and tried to get
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about the outside men?” the detective
went on; and I then found that there had been
other people on guard--these watching outside.
Someone went down and returned with a crest-fallen,
baffled air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saw nothing,” he said, “but this fellow”--looking
at Debson--“went down the stairs after
the lights went out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Ito spoke. “He has habit,” he explained,
“of spending evening with Jane, when
Mr. Kempwood suspect him to be answering
door-bell, it was therefore that I remove light
plug to delay Mr. Kempwood and cover retreat
of Debson, since we are friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true,” said Jane, beginning to cry,
“and I hope, sir, that you’ll not blame him,
since it is my fault and----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll do,” someone said, and she relapsed
into very moist-sounding sniffs. I don’t know
how the “servant class,” as aunt calls them,
manage to sniff like that, for theirs is a pervasive,
far-carrying sniff. But I notice that they always
employ it when they are thinking of leaving, and
perhaps strength comes from constant practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we go down and search,” said Amy.
“Probably he’s”--she pointed to S. K.’s man--“hidden
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never saw such a look of outraged innocence
as that man wore. “If there is any doubt,” he
said, “I will request a search. I am honest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there a blind man around?” I asked.
“Did you hear of him downstairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man whom I asked--the man who had
been outside--said there was. “But,” he said,
“I am afraid you won’t make a detective, miss.
He has been watched; he has not moved, and,
since this affair, he has been searched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where was he sitting?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to think of it,” said one of the men,
“I think he was sitting by a window that leads
to the coal cellars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got in coal to-day,” I said. “I heard
it go in. Possibly the inner window was not
replaced. If the grating only was locked, my
bracelet would go through that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I saw Debson move. And he spoke
quickly, and in doing so made me sure that he
was guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I said, I am honest,” he began, voice
shaking. “I love this girl”--he pointed to
Jane--“but, if you want my opinion, you will
not have to go as far as the basement to find
the bracelet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What leads you to say that?” asked the
man who was putting the questions. He asked
it sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My conscience,” replied S. K.’s servant,
“and a sudden recollection of having seen it on
her arm one night when I took her to the Clover
Leaf Social Club ball. I afterward saw it on
Miss Page’s arm when she was having tea with
Mr. Kempwood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane cried harder than ever. “Just onct,”
she gasped, “and, honest to Gawd, I never done
it again----”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no one was convinced. I felt sure that
Jane was being truthful, but I think I was alone
in this. Then, after dividing the men and leaving
the suspects guarded, a party was sent to
the basements. I went with them, and I--found
my bracelet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was wrapped in a piece of burlap and a string
was tied to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lowered from my window to the blind man,”
I said, as I triumphantly undid it. The man
who had told me I was not a detective told me
he would give me a job any day. I did feel
proud. Then we started upstairs once again,
and I heard how the bracelet had come back.
Evelyn did it, and, after she finished, Herbert
put his arm around her, which proved to me
that he does really care deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no mystery about that bracelet disappearing
and reappearing,” she said suddenly
and stridently, when I was being questioned about
that. “I have--until recently--cared a good
deal about <span class='it'>things</span>, possessions, and, in this--my
bracelet--I thought I had something that was
unique, individual. When Natalie appeared with
the real mate, it completely outshone mine and
annoyed me frightfully. I began to warn her not
to wear it, with hastily scribbled small notes
which I left out. She ignored these. I therefore
put it where she could not wear it. That
is, I locked it in my jewel-case. When I felt
that I must return it, I did so at night. Sometimes
when I went in, she stirred, and I, wanting
her to think the affair supernatural and not to
have her connect it with me, began to send it
back at the end of my riding-crop. I’d put the
handle against the bracelet and shove it in the
room just as far as I could reach; I don’t know
how many times I did it. That is what she means
when she said it ‘crept in by itself.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Naturally she didn’t see my crop, which is
dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only saw the glitter of the gold,” I said,
“and I didn’t know <span class='it'>you</span> didn’t want me to wear
it. If I had, of course I wouldn’t have
done so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seemed a joke then,” she went on. “I
didn’t think at first that Natalie could misunderstand,
and then--well, I was annoyed with her
and I let it go on. It was a form of ‘getting
even.’ I even tried to frighten her once or twice.
One night I stole her flashlight; she saw my
hand and was frightened, I think, for she called.
When I began to care more for you, Natalie,”
she continued in a different tone, and speaking
directly to me, “I was sorry, but--somehow--I
couldn’t say so. And because you’d stopped
telling of things that occurred to bother you, I
thought you weren’t frightened any more. I
know it was contemptible. I hope you can forgive
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course I said I did and I cared a lot for
her and that it didn’t matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you know your cousin’s writing?”
asked one of the men. I shook my head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it looked different in pencil,” I explained,
“and I suppose I never had even noticed
it in ink. Then I was so sure those notes came
from Madam Jumel. Her initials and Evelyn’s
are the same and----” Then I paused, but they
made me go on, and I had to tell of our family
misfortunes which had, to some minds, been
twisted about that bracelet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Amy, who had had to be silent, and who
had seen how gentle Herbert had been with
Evelyn after her confession, put in. I like Amy
most of the time, and we are good friends, but I
knew she made her confession hoping that she
would be thought noble and so that she would
be noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stole those violets,” she said, standing up.
“I myself, under the lure of an orchid and a wish
to snub some of my most intimate friends, put
those stockings in the box that went back to
Herbert!” Then she glared up at the ceiling
and clasped her hands. It was a pose she got
from Nazimova, but it didn’t look the way it did
under Nazimova’s touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope snapped at her so hard that I
felt sorry for her. “You were a little sneak,”
she said, “to let all of us punish your cousin for
weeks for something that <span class='it'>you</span> did. Sit down
and be quiet or leave the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only ask for forgiveness,” Amy went on
sadly, “and that will bring me peace. How
could I know, when I inserted those worn-out
yellow socks of Evelyn’s, that I was to wreck
the happiness of a care-free, girlish heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The detectives laughed, but S. K. glared at
her, and he muttered something about hoping
people wouldn’t believe everything they heard
hereafter!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I forgiven?” asked Amy. She made
her voice tremble beautifully. She had learned
to from those singing lesson records that you can
buy now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said she was, of course, and S. K. grunted.
And then he put his arm around me. It seemed
to be catching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to take care of you after this,”
he said through set teeth. “I have adopted you
for the present. Understand? No more of <span class='it'>that</span>
sort of nonsense shall occur!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about those noises outside--those
noises that were heard on the balcony?” someone
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane got in her innings then, and I imagine
that Debson was sorry he’d mentioned having
seen her wear my bracelet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He come up to see me that way,” she said;
“time and again he done it. He had a long
stick with a hook on top that he jabbed in a
window-sill or over the balcony rail, and then he
come up, hand over hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He <span class='it'>said</span> he
done a turn one year in vaudeville and that that
was in his bill----” And then she laughed
shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is true,” said Ito. “Greatly we laugh when
he approach in climb manner. It was in dark of
court. No one have opportunity to see. We
encourage him to arrive so like monkey. I think
he plan to come in such manners so that we in
back of apartment hear scrape noises. Jane will
think he visit me, I think he visit Jane, meanwhile
he inspect and salute Jumel bracelet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you want it?” asked the detective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Debson said he did not, loudly protesting his
innocence until one of our visiting gentlemen
went forward, slapped his pockets, and then
began to unload them. He found all sorts of
interesting things. An implement that is called
a “jimmy,” that is, I believe, largely used in
burglaries; a pistol; S. K.’s best cuff links;
and--most important--a ball of twine, and that
matched the piece that I found tied to the bracelet.
He had to give in, and when he saw that
protests amounted to nothing he talked frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I was safe,” said Debson, after
his conviction was achieved. “No one up <span class='it'>here</span>
believed the kid, and almost every night I prowled
around somewhere, and during the day too.
After I was thick with these two”--he motioned
to Ito and Jane--“why, it looked as exciting as
a Sunday-school picnic. To be sure, I hadn’t
located the right bracelet (she had a way of hiding
it), but I could get into her room any time I
wanted to. One afternoon I walked in and
busted the lock of the window, and no one said
nothing. I thought I had it all fixed and that
my hunting was over, for just to-day <span class='it'>he</span> promised
not to kick up a search until she wanted it. And
I believed it. I believed it!” After that he
looked at us and laughed, laughed in a silent,
sneering way, but I felt that his own failure was
what made his unhappy mirth; his own failure
and his being caught by such a simple trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you want it?” asked Uncle Archie.
“The thing isn’t worth enough for all the trouble
you gave it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that so, brother?” said the man, who as
a servant had had the most quiet voice and repressed
manner. “Just go ask Vicente Alcon y
Rodriguez! That boy’s a little Sugar King, and
he makes enough to sweeten several lives. <span class='it'>He</span>
offered me twenty-five thousand if I could get
the Jumel bracelet or its mate for him and get it
down to the monkey zone. And now--yuh got
me--what you going to do with me?” He
snarled this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll give you a nice chance to rest,”
answered one of the men pleasantly, and, taking
handcuffs from his pocket, snapped them on the
man who had made me so much trouble, and all
the mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder why the Sugar King wanted it?”
I asked as the men went off, taking Debson
between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find out,” S. K. answered. And he did.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Chapter XXIV</span>--<span class='sc'>What made the Chase</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>To</span> quote S. K., it had an entirely “sane and
logical” explanation, and it was started by that
little fellow who wears wings, carries a quiver,
is talked of and felt often, but is never seen--except
on Valentines. And of course you know
whom I mean. His name comes from an old
monk, which is strange, I think. S. K. said it
was not. He said that everybody has their
monastery garden where they, quite alone, make
the prettiest rhymes to love. And he explained
further that when you try to say them aloud, in
the fumbling words of men, they will not echo
even half of what is felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this discussion came because of the date,
which was February fourteenth. Much had happened
since Christmas week, and this day we all
sat in the living-room reviewing things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn was hemming napkins, and Herbert sat
on a foot-rest at her feet, muttering things like
“<span class='it'>Beautiful</span> hands!” or “Did she prick her
<span class='it'>sweet</span> finger!” which everybody heard, but had
to pretend they didn’t. (That’s a funny sentence,
but I haven’t time to alter it.) Amy and
Willy were doing a picture puzzle, S. K. was
sitting idle, and I was trying to address post-cards
to people at home. Personally, I don’t
like them, but the people to whom I was going
to send them did. I could take part in all the
talk, inasmuch as I only wrote, “Wish you were
here,” and, “This is a picture of Grant’s tomb,”
or, “The Woolworth Tower,” or whatever it
was. Of course, it said what the picture was, in
print; but people always do explain again in
writing on post-cards, I suppose because it fills
up space. Even real writers always use a great
deal of explaining to do that, I have noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willy would leave the table now and again to
read my messages, all of which were almost the
same, in a different voice. He made it deeply
dramatic, or Miss Hooper-high, and Amy giggled
awfully. She laughs at anything he says; and
he says she has more perception and appreciation
of true humour than any woman he has ever
met--which is what men always do say when
women laugh at their jokes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fifth time he made a tour to the desk he
picked up a card I had addressed to Colonel
Sephus I. Lemley, who did detective work in
Baltimore in 1892. He has been resting since
then, and his wife takes in sewing. He explained
that the business world was not a fit place for a
Southern gentleman. Willy told about how he
acts when he gets drunk. On one occasion he
painted the entire house with apple butter (his
wife had just made five crocks), and it was in
fly season, too. And on another he sawed out
the lower panel of the front door, and then he
got down on his hands and knees and stuck his
head through the hole and barked at everyone
who passed. That was really very funny, because
he has a little goatee which wags when he talks,
and to see his head, topped by a wide-brimmed
felt hat, and bottomed by wiggling fluff, to see
this sticking through a hole in the door and hear
him say, “Bow, wow!” in a high falsetto, was
enough to make you yell. For three days he
honestly thought he was Miss Hooper’s dog,
Rover. His wife was visiting in a near town.
When she is at home she tactfully restrains him,
with a broom, the neighbours say, and it is
noticeable that he stands in front of the Mansion
House after these attacks, instead of occupying
one of the rocking-chairs which trail all over the
porch and half across the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to get back. After Willy told of him, he
said he should have been on the job. And I
agreed. “No six weeks to find out what started
it, if Sephus had humped!” he stated, surely.
I nodded, for Colonel Lemley’s own tales of his
achievements made Sherlock Holmes’ affairs look
as exciting as the woven mats you do in the first
year of school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I wrote for perhaps fifteen more minutes
I finished my work and went over to sit by S. K.,
who was on the davenport before the fire. I
had on a lovely bunch of violets he had sent me,
and I was enjoying them a lot, also the prospect
for the evening, which was a theatre party, which
S. K. was giving because Evelyn and Herbert
are engaged. People seem to do things like that
for engaged people, quite as if they need cheering
up. And I was to wear a new dress, which
was pink and fluffy and, I must admit, becoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going to sit next to me, to-night,”
said S. K.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I hoped so, and then I was quiet, for I
was thinking how very much S. K. had done to
make my New York life happy and to smooth
out, and erase, my troubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bracelet business had made me half sick.
It had been so crawly. And it all happened because
a little coquette, who was the Spanish girl
we saw photographed in the Sunday paper, and
the one who muttered pretty Spanish admirations
over the bracelet (one of the people who stays
at the Mansion told me of those), had made her
lover a test. I think she did it in joke, but he
took it seriously because he was so very much
in love. Of course, he was Vicente Alcon y
Rodriguez, and it happened this way:</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had met her somewhere on a business trip.
I suppose he had letters of introduction which
admitted him almost anywhere, since he has a
great deal of money and is of great importance
in the business world of Cuba. And, like a good
many Latin men, he fell in love with her immediately,
and wildly so. He called her “orange
blossom,” and “white, sweet heart of the rose”
(that is, in notes), and he threatened to kill himself
if she didn’t love him, but he didn’t. And
she didn’t love him; she only laughed. That is,
at first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think she was capricious and liked to feel her
power, for she played with him. One day being
kind, and the next day scorning, as only her race
can scorn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. S. K. told me the story, and
he put in trimmings, as he always does. And I
am repeating in part from the tale that he related.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each day this man who had so much money--but
not the love he wanted more than all of the
world--would send her mountains of flowers, or
a strange string of beads, or candied fruits from
the Orient, or candies from our States. S. K.
said he was a good lover, and he sounded so. I
became very much interested, and I did not see
how Marguerita Angela Blanco y Chiappi could
help liking it, but sometimes she didn’t. One
morning she threw all of his flowers out on the
street, and then she called to him (he was lurking
around on the other side of the way; they
act that way more there than here), and she said:
“The scent in all of its heaviness is wearisome!”
And rumour states that he tore his hair, but I
think S. K. put that in for a nice touch, because
he had it clipped so short I don’t see how he
could get a decent hold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, things went on in that way. She would
soften, only to harden. And he would become
elated, only to taste the depth of despair. It
was very romantic. And then--Marguerita’s
father had a mission to perform in the United
States; she came along, and of course Vicente
Alcon y Rodriguez trailed at a respectful distance
(but he didn’t stay so), which is the paper-chase
manner in which some South American and Cuban
courtships come off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their pictures were taken together at the Jumel
Mansion, and so evidently she was a little kinder
to him then. And that was the day she paused
before the bracelet and said, “Es incomparable
lindo y yo lo deseo!” and she said it with hunger
floating on her liquid voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would that I could give it to you!” whispered
Vicente Alcon y Rodriguez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can give me nothing I want!” he was
answered, and after this pleasant speech the little
señorita shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. said he clenched his hands, glared ahead,
and then said: “A copy? A good copy, Fairest
Angel of Heaven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she said, “A copy? Bah!” and her lips
curled. I didn’t see why he loved her after that,
but S. K. said she stimulated his interest by
acting that way. But that I wasn’t to try it on
him, since his interest didn’t need stimulating.
Then Marguerita looked mischievous and said:
“The man who would get for me this original, I
would give the gift of my love.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But it is
a poor thing, my little heart, and perhaps not
worth the effort to get?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said: “You cast me to the depths.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
How can I live? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For this, you ask the
impossible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why ask the possible?” she said, “since
that I could get myself?” Then S. K. said
Vicente went out, sat down on the green bench
that faces the side gate, held his head in his
hands, and stared unseeingly at the gravel at his
feet. He said they both enjoyed acting that way
and being miserable, as a good many people do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Marguerita laughed in her tinkling way,
not seeming to care how unhappy she had made
him. Just before they started back to The
Biltmore, he spoke to her again. “You meant
that?” he said fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But certainly,” she replied. “I have said,
my heart in exchange for that bracelet!” And
then they all got in motors and started off for
lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, Vicente was determined to get that
bracelet, and he set out to do it. Somehow he
got into communication with Debson, offered him
twenty-five thousand dollars if he got the bracelet
and delivered it into his, Vicente Alcon y Rodriguez’s
hands, and then he sailed off on another
chase, for Marguerita and her papa had started
home again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much is simple, and the rest is only the
result of the start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Debson heard me tell the tale of my bracelet
that day I first visited the Mansion. Getting
the one in the case was not an easy affair, for
the place is well guarded, and so--he naturally
decided to get mine. It was he who chased me,
dodging behind things when I turned, and even
sitting on the kerb at the last with his cup for
pennies, and telling me that he was blind! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He had, of course, visited the Mansion often in
different disguise, hoping each time to have the
opportunity. And, of course, he began to lurk
around our apartment-house after he knew what
was in my possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a brother who worked with him; they
had an idea that confusion of evidence made evidence
weak, and so there were two blind men
around the Mansion that Sunday, and no two
people agreed about where they had seen the
shambling figure. It wasn’t a bad idea, for
during the investigation of that particular event
the police had been so tried by different stories
of where people had seen this old man that they
brushed aside any mention of him, and muttered
of “crowd hysteria.” It was the brother of
Debson who knocked S. K. down because he
had seen me give the bracelet into S. K.’s keeping.
It was he who was the old Italian woman
that day and who suddenly shed his shawl and
skirts and was again the blind man shuffling up
the steps. That was after he stuffed his woman-duds
in a basket of soiled clothes which some
neglectful small boy had left for a moment on
the sidewalk while he went up to join the crowd
around Sammy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was clever, I think, for when the washwoman
returned the things washed, the Italian
garb was probably sent back to her with a word
that it did not belong in that particular laundry,
and she, the washwoman, was, I suppose, glad
enough to keep the garments and say no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, that same afternoon, Debson had
seen me give the bracelet to the keeper--probably
he peered through a window, or half hid
behind a big pillar outside--and it was he who
attacked him, after the crowd had gone out to
see what had happened to S. K.; and he who,
with tears running down his face, called for help--since
getting away was dangerous. It all seems
very simple--now--and makes us seem great
fools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When S. K. advertised for a servant, Debson
applied for the position, and fortune favoured
him, since I often went to see S. K. and talked
all my troubles over with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He used a long rod with a hook on top of it
to get upstairs, since the back entrances were too
public for his late night visits, and he could come
in this way under the dark of the court. For
people kept their shades down in their court
windows. Other windows are too close to do
otherwise. He made those tapping noises that
night everyone was frightened and Uncle Archie
fell over the pedestal, and it was only coincidence
that made them tap in three in that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also made violent love to Jane, thinking
perhaps that he could get her help, or that in
that way his visits to our apartment would be
accounted for. But it was not my bracelet, but
Evelyn’s, she wore that night he took her to the
ball. And she wore it because he had talked
so much of how greatly a bracelet “enhanced
the fair roundness of a woman’s arm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
Jane admitted that statement “got her,” and
it must have, for she remembered it absolutely
correctly. Evelyn at that time sometimes substituted
her bracelet for mine, because the Tiffany
mark made her story of its being real a lie; and
she, at that time, wanted the real one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane told me lots about it. “It was that
romantic, miss,” she said, “to hear a tap, and
then to lean from the window, and to see him
coming hand over hand up that there rod with
the hook on top. And it used to turn me sick
like, to think that he might fall, but he never
did--worse luck!” And then she sniffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a very hard time, for I hid my bracelet
often and Evelyn took it too, and it seemed that
every time he called it was out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of course,
he had come up that night that we had the
detectives waiting, for he thought it was his last
chance, and of course it was he whom I followed
down the fire-escape. He expected to bag the
bracelet easily that night that he was caught.
He was going to get it in some way, and he had
been sure that would be easy; then lower it to
his brother, who would, if possible, take it off;
if not, throw it, as he did, in the coal cellar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found out everything and began to believe
S. K.’s remark about sanity and logical reasons
for all events. I even found out about Jane’s
blushes and the ice-pick. It seemed she used
to give Debson suppers when he came up, and
she gave him a very nice grape juice that aunt
had got for Evelyn. It was that that made her
so anxious to speak of thefts as borrowing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And again there was coincidence in the hurt
hands. All but Debson’s had happened from
innocent causes. His came from my mouse-trap,
but to throw people off the scent he deliberately
broke that Stiegel glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, I was shadowed and followed, and
it was Debson’s brother who pulled me from my
mount on Riverside Drive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two men who
are very intent on getting anything can think
lots of ways to get it, and--twenty-five thousand
dollars is quite an incentive. I felt sorry for the
men--I couldn’t help it--and for Vicente Alcon
y Rodriguez, for I was afraid Marguerita would
never marry him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wrote Señor Vicente Alcon y Rodriguez and
told him how sorry I was and that I would give
him my bracelet if my mother had not owned
and worn it, and that I hoped perhaps Señorita
Blanco y Chiappi could get one made like it.
And I explained about how nice Evelyn’s was.
I really wanted to send my bracelet to Señor
Alcon y Rodriguez, but S. K., who occasionally
gives me orders quite as if he had every right to,
would not permit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” he said. “She’s only tiring
him out. After he begins to gasp and shows
signs of giving up, she’ll pull him in the boat. I
know ’em!” which I considered cynical. But
she did. Just that very thing happened, and I
got a piece of wedding cake. They were married
January twentieth after an engagement of two
days. He answered my note most courteously
and apologized at length. And she added a little
line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have capitulated,” she acknowledged, in
a very shaded, elaborate writing. “It is useless
to allow innocent childs to be stabbed in back
because of my light mention of a bracelet, and
because of his great urgency I have achieved for
myself the married state. We are happy and
wish you the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she said she kissed my feet, which is
very polite Spanish, and signed herself undyingly
and affectionately mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Señor Vicente gave S. K.’s words backing
when he wrote: “I was willing to give up. All
was despair. I vowed I would not request again,
when lo! she softened and turned to me the glory
of her love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was glad it ended that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you thinking of?” asked S. K.
that afternoon of February fourteenth when we
were all together and yet--all sort of paired off
in the living-room. I told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like to see people love the people who
love them,” I said. “Now Evelyn has answered
the right call, and I think Amy is going to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” said S. K. “You don’t mean
those kids----” He didn’t finish his sentence,
but he meant that Amy and Willy weren’t old
enough to do anything but all the latest waltz
and fox steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure they’re going to throw into it,” I
said. “Somehow--I feel it. They slam each
other now, and disagree terribly, but he has unexpected
moments of patience with her, and
when he has those I can see that he likes her
lots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort?” asked S. K., looking at them.
They were doing a one-step, and Amy said Willy
did it all wrong, and Willy said no Northerner
could dance. What with the victrola and their
quarrelling, we could shout anything and not be
heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him. “He is trying to explain baseball
to her,” I said, “since you said you’d take us all
to all the games. And after he finished yesterday
she said: ‘I don’t think it’s <span class='it'>polite</span> or nice
for the man with the stick to wave it in front of
the man with the little thing like a dish-drain
over his face!’ She saw a game last year, and
that’s all she got out of it!” And I went on
to explain how well Willy played and how he
would usually greet that sort of a remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. laughed and after a little more watching
them agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” I went on, “I asked her last night
whether she was going to marry the broker, and
she clasped her hands, stared ahead, and whispered:
‘<span class='it'>What a child I was!</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>S. K. laughed some more. Then he sobered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” he said, “you like to see the ‘fellow
get the girl’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I thought everyone was disappointed in
books or life, if he didn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he mentioned a subject that he hadn’t
touched for ages and didn’t mean to then. I
think it slipped out. And I found I didn’t mind,
but really liked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think,” he asked in an undertone,
“that this fellow is going to get her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, S. K.,” I answered, as I slipped my
hand in his, “I <span class='it'>know</span> he is! And you do too!
How <span class='it'>can</span> you help it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear child!” said S. K. “My <span class='it'>dear</span>
child!” He said it in that tight way in which
people speak when they care very much, and he
pressed my hand between both of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you talking of over there?” asked
Evelyn, looking up from her work. And I gave
an answer which did not surprise her, for everyone
did talk of them a great deal--if not exactly
the sort S. K. and I had touched that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re discussing mysteries,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” added S. K., looking down at me.
And then Ito came in, trundling a tea-waggon
ahead of him. I saw that he had Aunt Penelope’s
best service on it, little cakes in paper cases, and
big pink roses on the napkins. It looked pretty,
festive and good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is day of love,” said Ito. “We have
fancy tea!”</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
